Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of mortality from infectious
disease worldwide. One of the factors involved in developing disease is the
genetics of the host, yet the field of TB susceptibility genetics has not yielded
the answers that were expected. A commonly posited explanation for the missing
heritability of complex disease is gene-gene interactions, also referred to as
epistasis. In this study we investigate the role of gene-gene interactions in
genetic susceptibility to TB using a cohort recruited from a high TB incidence
community from Cape Town, South Africa. Our discovery data set incorporates
genotypes from a large a number of candidate gene studies as well as genome-wide 
data. After limiting our search space to pairs of putative TB susceptibility
genes, as well as pairs of genes that have been curated in online databases as
potential interactors, we use statistical modelling to identify pairs of
interacting SNPs. We attempt to validate the top models identified in our
discovery data set using an independent genome-wide TB case-control data set from
The Gambia. A number of models were successfully validated, indicating that
interplay between the NRG1 - NRG3, GRIK1 - GRIK3 and IL23R - ATG4C gene pairs may
modify susceptibility to TB. Gene pairs involved in the NF-κB pathway were also
identified in the discovery data set (SFTPD - NOD2, ISG15 - TLR8 and NLRC5 -
IL12RB1), but could not be tested in the Gambian study group due to lack of
overlapping data.

Schizophrenia patients often show irregularities in sleep and circadian rhythms
and deficits in recognition memory. Similar phenotypes are seen in
schizophrenia-relevant genetic mouse models, such as synaptosomal associated
protein of 25 kDa (Snap-25) point mutant mice, vasoactive intestinal peptide
receptor 2 (Vipr2) knockout mice, and neuregulin 1 (Nrg1)-deficient mice. Sleep
and circadian abnormalities and impaired recognition memory may be causally
related in both schizophrenia patients and schizophrenia-relevant mouse models,
since sleep deprivation, abnormal photic input, and the manipulation of core
clock genes (cryptochrome 1/2) can all disrupt object recognition memory in
rodent models. The recognition deficits observed in patients and mouse models
(both schizophrenia-related and -unrelated) are discussed here in terms of the
dual-process theory of recognition, which postulates that there are two
recognition mechanisms-recollection versus familiarity-that can be selectively
impaired by brain lesions, neuropsychiatric conditions, and putatively, sleep and
circadian rhythm disruption. However, based on this view, the findings from
patient studies and studies using genetic mouse models (Nrg1 deficiency) seem to 
be inconsistent with each other. Schizophrenia patients are impaired at
recollection (and to a lesser extent, familiarity judgments), but Nrg1-deficient 
mice are impaired at familiarity-based object recognition, raising concerns
regarding the validity of using these genetically modified mice to model
recognition phenotypes observed in patients. This issue can be resolved in future
animal studies by examining performance in different variants of the spontaneous 
recognition task-the standard, perirhinal cortex-dependent, object recognition
task versus the hippocampus-dependent object-place recognition task-in order to
see which of the two recognition mechanisms is more disrupted.

Accumulating evidence from human genetic studies has suggested several functional
candidate genes that might contribute to susceptibility to schizophrenia,
including AKT1 and neuregulin 1 (NRG1). Recent findings also revealed that NRG1
stimulates the PI3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway, which might be involved in the
functional outcomes of some schizophrenic patients. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of Akt1-deficiency and Nrg1-deficiency alone or in
combination in the regulation of behavioral phenotypes, cognition, and social
functions using genetically modified mice as a model. Male Akt1 (+/-), Nrg1
(+/-), and double mutant mice were bred and compared with their wild-type (WT)
littermate controls. In Experiment 1, general physical examination revealed that 
all mutant mice displayed a normal profile of body weight during development and 
a normal brain activity with microPET scan. In Experiment 2, no significant
genotypic differences were found in our basic behavioral phenotyping, including
locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and sensorimotor gating function. However,
both Nrg1 (+/-) and double mutant mice exhibited impaired episodic-like memory.
Double mutant mice also had impaired sociability. In Experiment 3, a synergistic 
epistasis between Akt1 and Nrg1 was further confirmed in double mutant mice in
that they had impaired social interaction compared to the other 3 groups,
especially encountering with a novel male or an ovariectomized female. Double
mutant and Nrg1 (+/-) mice also emitted fewer female urine-induced ultrasonic
vocalization calls. Collectively, our results indicate that double deficiency of 
Akt1 and Nrg1 can result in the impairment of social cognitive functions, which
might be pertinent to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia-related social cognition.

[Role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders].

[Article in Japanese]

Nunomura A, Tamaoki T, Motohashi N.

The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage because of its high rate
of oxygen consumption, abundant lipid content, and relative paucity of
antioxidant enzymes compared with other organs. It has been well established that
oxidative stress (OS) is involved in the pathogenesis of age-associated
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, a large
number of genetic and environmental factors of neurodegenerative disorders are
associated with OS. Of note, studies on the levels of oxidative damage in
patients with the prodromal stage of AD, transgenic animal models of AD, and
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from AD patients support the
early-stage involvement of OS in the pathological cascade of the disorder.
Recently, a growing body of evidence suggests that a considerable number of
genetic and environmental factors of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia 
(SZ), bipolar disorders, and depression are associated with OS. Not only genetic 
polymorphisms in genes encoding antioxidant enzymes but also several known
susceptible genes for psychiatric disorders, i. e., Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 
(DISC1), Neuregulin 1 (NRG1), proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), and G72, are all
associated with increased levels of OS or decreased antioxidant capacities.
Moreover, environmental factors such as infection, hypoxia, malnutrition, illicit
substance use, and psychosocial stress are possibly associated with OS. In fact, 
increased levels of oxidized nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids have been
described in the postmortem brains of patients with SZ and bipolar disorders, and
decreased antioxidant capacities have been described in blood samples obtained
from patients with first-episode psychosis. In concordance, iPS cells from SZ
patients show an increased level of OS. Of particular interest is a conditional
gene knockout mouse model of SZ with the functional elimination of NMDA receptors
specifically from cortical interneurons. The NMDA receptor knockout mouse shows
behavioral phenotypes resembling symptoms of human SZ. Importantly, a marked
increase of OS, particularly in the cortical parvalbumin-positive interneurons,
is rapidly exacerbated by post-weaning social isolation, but treatment with
antioxidants abolishes OS and partially alleviates the SZ-like behavioral
phenotypes. Therefore, it is suggested that OS is a convergence point for genetic
and environmental susceptibilities to not only neurodegenerative but also
psychiatric disorders. In other words, OS potentially plays a central role in the
pathomechanisms that integrate gene-environment interactions in neuropsychiatric 
disorders. Further investigations into the development of useful OS biomarkers
and efficacious OS-targeting interventions may shed light on a promising approach
for establishing preemptive strategies against neuropsychiatric disorders.

Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and ErbB4 genes have been identified as candidate genes for
schizophrenia. Post-mortem studies indicated that NRG1-ErbB4 signalling is
impaired in schizophrenia subjects. This study investigated whether short- or
long-term antipsychotic treatment has different effects on the expression of NRG1
and ErbB4 receptors. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally with either
aripiprazole (0.75 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg), or
vehicle, 3 times/day for 1 or 12 weeks. Western blotting was performed to examine
the expression of NRG1 isoforms (135 kDa, 70 kDa and 40 kDa) and ErbB4 receptors.
Both 1-week haloperidol and olanzapine treatment increased NRG1-70kDa expression 
in the hippocampus; haloperidol also up-regulated ErbB4 levels in the prefrontal 
cortex (PFC). In the 12-week group, aripiprazole decreased the expression of all 
three NRG1 isoforms and ErbB4 receptors in the PFC, NRG1-70 kDa and -40 kDa in
the cingulate cortex (Cg), and NRG1-135 kDa, -70 kDa and ErbB4 receptors in the
hippocampus; haloperidol reduced NRG1-135 kDa in the PFC, NRG1-40 kDa in all
three brain regions, and ErbB4 receptor levels in the PFC and hippocampus;
NRG1-40 kDa in the PFC and Cg was also down-regulated by olanzapine. These
results suggest that the time-dependent and region-specific effects of
antipsychotics on NRG1-ErbB4 signalling may contribute to the efficacy of
antipsychotics to treat schizophrenia.

Recombinant neuregulin 1 does not activate cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis in normal 
or infarcted adult mice.

OBJECTIVES: Neuregulin 1 signaling plays an important role in cardiac trabecular 
development, and in sustaining functional integrity in adult hearts. Treatment
with neuregulin 1 enhances adult cardiomyocyte differentiation, survival and/or
function in vitro and in vivo. It has also been suggested that recombinant
neuregulin 1β1 (NRG1β1) induces cardiomyocyte proliferation in normal and injured
adult hearts. Here we further explore the impact of neuregulin 1 signaling on
adult cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult mice were subjected to 9 consecutive daily injections 
of recombinant NRG1β1 or vehicle, and cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis was quantitated
via bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, which was delivered using
mini-osmotic pumps over the entire duration of NRG1β1 treatment. NRG1β1 treatment
inhibited baseline rates of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis in normal mice
(cardiomyocyte labelling index: 0.019±0.005% vs. 0.003±0.001%, saline vs. NRG1β1,
P<0.05). Acute NRG1β1 treatment did result in activation of Erk1/2 and cardiac
myosin regulatory light chain (down-stream mediators of neuregulin signalling),
as well as activation of DNA synthesis in non-cardiomyocytes, validating the
biological activity of the recombinant protein. In other studies, mice were
subjected to permanent coronary artery occlusion, and cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis
was monitored via tritiated thymidine incorporation which was delivered as a
single injection 7 days post-infarction. Daily NRG1β1 treatment had no impact on 
cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis in the infarcted myocardium (cardiomyocyte labelling 
index: 0.039±0.011% vs. 0.027±0.021%, saline vs. NRG1β1, P>0.05).
SUMMARY: These data indicate that NRG1β1 treatment does not increase
cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis (and consequently does not increase the rate of
cardiomyocyte renewal) in normal or infarcted adult mouse hearts. Thus, any
improvement in cardiac structure and function observed following neuregulin
treatment of injured hearts likely occurs independently of overt myocardial
regeneration.

PURPOSE: ERBB3 is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of human cancers, and its
aberrant activation is associated with tumor pathogenesis and therapeutic
resistance to various anticancer agents. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is the predominant
ligand for ERBB3 and can promote the heterodimerization of ERBB3 with other ERBB 
family members, resulting in activation of multiple intracellular signaling
pathways. AV-203 is a humanized IgG1/κ ERBB3 inhibitory antibody that completed a
first-in-human phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. The
purpose of this preclinical study was to identify potential biomarker(s) that may
predict response to AV-203 treatment in the clinic.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted in vivo efficacy studies using a broad panel of
xenograft models representing a wide variety of human cancers. To identify
biomarkers that can predict response to AV-203, the relationship between tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) by AV-203 and the expression levels of ERBB3 and NRG1
were evaluated in these tumor models.
RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between the levels of NRG1
expression and TGI by AV-203. In contrast, TGI was not correlated with ERBB3
expression. The correlation between the levels of NRG1 expression in tumors and
their response to ERBB3 inhibition by AV-203 was further validated using
patient-derived tumor explant models.
CONCLUSIONS: NRG1 is a promising biomarker that can predict response to ERBB3
inhibition by AV-203 in preclinical human cancer models. NRG1 warrants further
clinical evaluation and validation as a potential predictive biomarker of
response to AV-203.

In vitro approaches have suggested that neuropsin (or kallikrein 8/KLK8), which
controls gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through neuregulin-1
(NRG-1) and its receptor (ErbB4), is involved in neural plasticity (Tamura et
al., 2012, 2013). In the present study, we examined whether parvalbumin
(PV)-positive neuronal networks, the majority of which are ErbB4-positive
GABAergic interneurons, are controlled by neuropsin in tranquil and stimulated
voluntarily behaving mice. Parvalbumin-immunoreactive fibers surrounding
hippocampal pyramidal and granular neurons in mice reared in their home cage were
decreased in neuropsin-deficient mice, suggesting that neuropsin controls PV
immunoreactivity. One- or two-week exposures of wild mice to novel environments, 
in which they could behave freely and run voluntarily in a wheel resulted in a
marked upregulation of both neuropsin mRNA and protein in the hippocampus. To
elucidate the functional relevance of the increase in neuropsin during exposure
to a rich environment, the intensities of PV-immunoreactive fibers were compared 
between neuropsin-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice under environmental stimuli. 
When mice were transferred into novel cages (large cages with toys), the
intensity of PV-immunoreactive fibers increased in WT mice and
neuropsin-deficient mice. Therefore, behavioral stimuli control a
neuropsin-independent form of PV immunoreactivity. However, the
neuropsin-dependent part of the change in PV-immunoreactive fibers may occur in
the stimulated hippocampus because increased levels of neuropsin continued during
these enriched conditions.

Lung cancer is emerging as a paradigm for disease molecular subtyping,
facilitating targeted therapy based on driving somatic alterations. Here we
perform transcriptome analysis of 153 samples representing lung adenocarcinomas, 
squamous cell carcinomas, large cell lung cancer, adenoid cystic carcinomas and
cell lines. By integrating our data with The Cancer Genome Atlas and published
sources, we analyse 753 lung cancer samples for gene fusions and other
transcriptomic alterations. We show that higher numbers of gene fusions is an
independent prognostic factor for poor survival in lung cancer. Our analysis
confirms the recently reported CD74-NRG1 fusion and suggests that NRG1, NF1 and
Hippo pathway fusions may play important roles in tumours without known driver
mutations. In addition, we observe exon-skipping events in c-MET, which are
attributable to splice site mutations. These classes of genetic aberrations may
play a significant role in the genesis of lung cancers lacking known driver
mutations.

This study investigated the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms 
in the neurodevelopmental Disrupted In Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1 ), neuregulin 1
(NRG1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NOTCH4 genes and the
clinical symptoms and the occurrence of treatment-resistant schizophrenia in the 
Slovenian population. We included 138 schizophrenia patients, divided into
treatment-responsive and treatment-resistant group and 94 healthy blood donors.
All subjects were genotyped for eight polymorphisms (DISC1 rs6675281, DISC1
rs821616, NRG1 rs3735781, NRG1 rs3735782, NRG1 rs10503929, NRG1 rs3924999, BDNF
rs6265, NOTCH rs367398) and investigated for associations with clinical
variables. NOTCH4 rs367398 AA/AG was significantly associated with worse Positive
and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score.
NOTCH4 rs367398 was not statistically significantly associated with the
occurrence of treatment-resistant schizophrenia after the correction for multiple
testing. Our data indicate that NOTCH4 polymorphism can influence clinical
symptoms in Slovenian patients with schizophrenia.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic
neurons, neurons that are regulated by the development, protection and function
of neuregulin-1 (NRG1)-ErbB4 signals, in the substantia nigra (SN). NRG1 is a
neurotrophic differentiation factor and one of its isoforms is a sensory and
motor neuron-derived factor (SMDF), mostly expressed in neurons. To examine the
relationship between NRG1 SMDF and PD, we tested whether NRG1 SMDF can be
detected and measured in plasma and whether their level in plasma correlates with
the clinical severity of PD. We detected NRG1 SMDF to be immunoreactive in
plasma. Using an ELISA method specific for NRG1 SMDF, we found that NRG1 SMDF
levels were significantly reduced in sporadic PD as compared to controls.
However, levels of plasma NRG1 SMDF showed no correlation with the clinical
severity of PD. Additionally, we found that there was a correlation of NRG1 SMDF 
levels in CSF with that in plasma where levels in plasma were significantly
higher, at approximately ten times that in CSF. Finally, we also examined the
expression of NRG1 SMDF in the post-mortem brain using immunohistochemistry and
showed that Lewy bodies in the SN of patients with PD were immunoreactive for
NRG1 SMDF. In summary, we found that the reduction of plasma NRG1 SMDF is
specifically associated with PD, but has no correlation with the clinical
severity of PD. These findings of NRG1 SMDF may provide important complementary
information for diagnosing the onset of PD.

Schizophrenic patients show altered sensory perception as well as changes in
electrical and magnetic brain responses to sustained, frequency-modulated sensory
stimulation. Both the amplitude and temporal precision of the neural responses
differ in patients as compared to control subjects, and these changes are most
pronounced for stimulation at gamma frequencies (20-40 Hz). In addition, patients
display enhanced spontaneous gamma oscillations, which has been interpreted as
'neural noise' that may interfere with normal stimulus processing. To investigate
electrophysiological markers of aberrant sensory processing in a model of
schizophrenia, we recorded neuronal activity in primary somatosensory cortex of
mice heterozygous for the schizophrenia susceptibility gene Neuregulin 1. Sensory
responses to sustained 20-70 Hz whisker stimulation were analyzed with respect to
firing rates, spike precision (phase locking) and gamma oscillations, and
compared to baseline conditions. The mutants displayed elevated spontaneous
firing rates, a reduced gain in sensory-evoked spiking and gamma activity, and
reduced spike precision of 20-40 Hz responses. These findings present the first
in vivo evidence of the linkage between a genetic marker and altered stimulus
encoding, thus suggesting a novel electrophysiological endophenotype of
schizophrenia.

Spermatogenesis is a continuous and productive process supported by the
self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which arise
from undifferentiated precursors known as gonocytes and are strictly controlled
in a special 'niche' microenvironment in the seminiferous tubules. Sertoli cells,
the only somatic cell type in the tubules, directly interact with SSCs to control
their proliferation and differentiation through the secretion of specific
factors. Spermatocyte meiosis is another key step of spermatogenesis, which is
regulated by Sertoli cells on the luminal side of the blood-testis barrier
through paracrine signaling. In this review, we mainly focus on the role of
Sertoli cells in the regulation of SSC self-renewal and spermatocyte meiosis,
with particular emphasis on paracrine and endocrine-mediated signaling pathways. 
Sertoli cell growth factors, such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor 
(GDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), as well as Sertoli cell
transcription factors, such as ETS variant 5 (ERM; also known as ETV5),
nociceptin, neuregulin 1 (NRG1), and androgen receptor (AR), have been identified
as the most important upstream factors that regulate SSC self-renewal and
spermatocyte meiosis. Other transcription factors and signaling pathways
(GDNF-RET-GFRA1 signaling, FGF2-MAP2K1 signaling, CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling,
CCL9-CCR1 signaling, FSH-nociceptin/OPRL1, retinoic acid/FSH-NRG/ERBB4, and
AR/RB-ARID4A/ARID4B) are also addressed.

Molecular Pathways: Targeting NRG1 Fusions in Lung Cancer.

The four members of the ERBB (HER) family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine
kinases are frequently activated in cancer by several mechanisms, such as
mutation, amplification, or autocrine ligand-receptor stimulation. We recently
identified gene fusions involving the ERBB ligand gene, NRG1, which represent a
novel mechanism for ERBB pathway deregulation. These fusions lead to expression
and presentation of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 on the cell surface, which binds 
to ERBB3 in an autocrine and juxtacrine manner, thus inducing the formation of
ERBB2-ERBB3 heterodimers, and subsequent activation of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK
signaling pathways. These fusion genes were exclusively detected in lung
adenocarcinomas of never smokers of the invasive mucinous subtype, which usually 
presents as a multifocal and unresectable disease, for which no effective
treatment exists. Considering the large amount of drugs that target ERBB2 (HER2) 
and ERBB3 (HER3), and which are currently in different stages of clinical
development, detecting and targeting NRG1 fusions in invasive mucinous lung
adenocarcinomas may represent a therapeutic opportunity for this aggressive
disease.

Neuregulin 1-activated ERBB4 interacts with YAP to induce Hippo pathway target
genes and promote cell migration.

The receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB4, a member of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) family, is unusual in that ERBB4 can undergo intramembrane
proteolysis, releasing a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that modulates
transcription in the nucleus. We found that ERBB4 activated the transcriptional
coactivator YAP, which promotes organ and tissue growth and is inhibited by the
Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway. Overexpressing ERBB4 in cultured mammary
epithelial cells or adding the ERBB4 ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) to breast cancer 
cell cultures promoted the expression of genes regulated by YAP, such as CTGF.
Knocking down YAP or ERBB4 prevented the induction of CTGF expression by NRG1, as
did treating cells with the ERBB inhibitors lapatinib or erlotinib, which reduced
ERBB4 cleavage. NRG1 stimulated YAP activity to an extent comparable to that of
EGF (epidermal growth factor) or LPA (lysophosphatidic acid), known activators of
YAP. NRG1 stimulated YAP-dependent cell migration in breast cancer cell lines.
These observations connect the unusual nuclear function of a growth factor
receptor with a mechanosensory pathway and suggest that NRG1-ERBB4-YAP signaling 
contributes to the aggressive behavior of tumor cells.

The Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway is regulated by several multicomponent
complexes of cell polarity and cell-to-cell junctions. Hippo kinases inhibit the 
transcription coactivator YAP. In contrast to the orthologous pathway in
Drosophila, in which the single transmembrane receptor Fat and its ligand
Dachsous are "dedicated" to trigger the pathway, the mammalian Hippo-YAP pathway 
was without such a dedicated receptor. In this issue of Science Signaling, a
study by Haskins et al. has brought an end to this scenario of an "orphaned"
pathway by identifying neuregulin 1 and its cognate receptor ERBB4 [epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) family member v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic
leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4] as a major receptor complex that activates YAP
activity. Moreover, the identification of ERBB4 as a dominant receptor of YAP
signaling brings into focus the signaling interface between the EGFR signaling
axis and the Hippo-YAP network, with numerous implications for basic and applied 
cancer research.

BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a neurocristopathy characterized by
absence of intramural ganglion cells along variable lengths of the
gastrointestinal tract in neonates. Three polymorphisms, rs2435357, within a
conserved transcriptional enhancer of RET, and, rs7835688 and rs16879552, within 
intron 1 of NRG1, have been shown to be associated with isolated forms of HSCR.
We wished to replicate these findings, and study the interactions between these
variants, in Indonesian HSCR patients.
METHODS: Sixty isolated HSCR patients and 124 controls were ascertained for this 
study. The three genetic markers were examined using TaqMan Genotyping Assays in 
genomic DNA for association studies.
RESULTS: RET rs2435357 showed the strongest association with HSCR both by
case-control analysis (p=2.5 × 10(-8)) and transmission disequilibrium test
(p=4.2 × 10(-6)). NRG1 rs7835688 was modestly associated with HSCR only by
case-control analysis (p=4.3 × 10(-3)), whereas rs16879552 demonstrated no
association (p>0.097). Two locus analyses of variants showed significant
interactions with increased and decreased disease risks of HSCR at NRG1 but
conditional on rs2435357 genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: RET and NRG1 variants are common susceptibility factors for HSCR in 
Indonesia. These common variants demonstrate that development of HSCR requires
joint effects of RET and NRG1 early in gut development.

BACKGROUND: Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in
brain-expressed genes represent interesting candidates for genetic research in
neuropsychiatric disorders.
PURPOSE: To study novel nsSNPs in brain-expressed genes in a sample of Colombian 
subjects.
METHODS: We applied an approach based on in silico mining of available genomic
data to identify and select novel nsSNPs in brain-expressed genes. We developed
novel genotyping assays, based in allele-specific PCR methods, for these nsSNPs
and genotyped them in 171 Colombian subjects.
RESULTS: Five common nsSNPs (rs6855837; p.Leu395Ile, rs2305160; p.Thr394Ala,
rs10503929; p.Met289Thr, rs2270641; p.Thr4Pro and rs3822659; p.Ser735Ala) were
studied, located in the CLOCK, NPAS2, NRG1, SLC18A1 and WWC1 genes. We reported
allele and genotype frequencies in a sample of South American healthy subjects.
There is previous experimental evidence, arising from genome-wide expression and 
association studies, for the involvement of these genes in several
neuropsychiatric disorders and endophenotypes, such as schizophrenia, mood
disorders or memory performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Frequencies for these nsSNPSs in the Colombian samples varied in
comparison to different HapMap populations. Future study of these nsSNPs in
brain-expressed genes, a synaptogenomics approach, will be important for a better
understanding of neuropsychiatric diseases and endophenotypes in different
populations.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to address the affects of mood
modifying drugs on the transcriptome, in a tissue culture model, using qPCR
arrays as a cost effective approach to identifying regulatory networks and
pathways that might coordinate the cell response to a specific drug.
METHODS: We addressed the gene expression profile of 90 plus genes associated
with human mood disorders using the StellARray™ qPCR gene expression system in
the human derived SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line.
RESULTS: Global Pattern Recognition (GPR) analysis identified a total of 9 genes 
(DRD3(⁎), FOS(†), JUN(⁎), GAD1(⁎†), NRG1(⁎), PAFAH1B3(⁎), PER3(⁎), RELN(⁎) and
RGS4(⁎)) to be significantly regulated in response to cellular challenge with the
mood stabilisers sodium valproate ((⁎)) and lithium ((†)). Modulation of FOS and 
JUN highlights the importance of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription
factor pathway in the cell response. Enrichment analysis of transcriptional
networks relating to this gene set also identified the transcription factor
neuron restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) and the oestrogen receptor as an
important regulatory mechanism.
LIMITATIONS: Cell line models offer a window of what might happen in vivo but
have the benefit of being human derived and homogenous with regard to cell type.
CONCLUSIONS: This data highlights transcription factor pathways, acting
synergistically or separately, in the modulation of specific neuronal gene
networks in response to mood stabilising drugs. This model can be utilised in the
comparison of the action of multiple drug regimes or for initial screening
purposes to inform optimal drug design.

Inhibitory neurotransmission in amygdala is important for fear learning and
memory. However, mechanisms that control the inhibitory activity in amygdala are 
not well understood. We provide evidence that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its
receptor ErbB4 tyrosine kinase are critical for maintaining GABAergic activity in
amygdala. Neutralizing endogenous NRG1, inhibition, or genetic ablation of ErbB4,
which was expressed in a majority of palvalbumin (PV)+ neurons in amygdala,
reduced GABAergic transmission and inhibited tone-cued fear conditioning.
Specific ablation of ErbB4 in PV+ neurons reduced eIPSC/eEPSC ratios and impaired
fear conditioning. Notably, expression of ErbB4 in amygdala was sufficient to
diminish synaptic dysfunction and fear conditioning deficits in PV-ErbB4-/- mice.
These observations indicated that NRG1 signaling maintains high GABAergic
activity in amygdala and, thus, regulates fear memory. Considering that both NRG1
and ErbB4 are susceptibility genes of schizophrenia, our study sheds light on
potential pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder.

Cyclic mechanical stress modulates neurotrophic and myelinating gene expression
of Schwann cells.

(1)State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China School of Stomatology,
Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the response of Schwann cells to
cyclic compressive and tensile stresses of different durations of stimulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RSC96 cells were subjected to cyclic tensile stress or
compressive stress; for either, cells in five groups were treated for 0, 1, 2, 24
and 48 h respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to detect 
secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4 in the culture medium. Real-time PCR was
conducted to quantify mRNA expression of neurotrophins including NGF, BDNF,
neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4, and myelin-related genes including Sox10,
Krox20, neuregulin 1, NCAM, N-cadherin, P0, MAG and MBP. Immunofluorescent
staining was performed to visualize Krox20 and F-actin in the tensile groups.
RESULTS: Within 24 h, cells treated with cyclic tensile stress expressed and
secreted significantly more BDNF, while cyclic compression down-regulated BDNF
expression. Cells treated with both tensile and compressive stress down-regulated
expression of NRG1, NCAM, Krox20 and Sox10 at all time points. Expression of
N-cadherin was not affected by either stretch or compression. F-actin was
down-regulated by tensile stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Both tensile and compressive loading down-regulated expression of
several important myelin-related Schwann cells genes and thus facilitated
demyelination. Tensile stress meanwhile promoted secretion of BDNF by Schwann
cells within 24 h, which may contribute to maintenance and repair of damaged
axons. These effects of mechanical stress might have been mediated by the actin
cytoskeleton.

We describe a rapid target enrichment method for next-generation sequencing,
termed anchored multiplex PCR (AMP), that is compatible with low nucleic acid
input from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. AMP is effective in
detecting gene rearrangements (without prior knowledge of the fusion partners),
single nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions and copy number changes.
Validation of a gene rearrangement panel using 319 FFPE samples showed 100%
sensitivity (95% confidence limit: 96.5-100%) and 100% specificity (95%
confidence limit: 99.3-100%) compared with reference assays. On the basis of our 
experience with performing AMP on 986 clinical FFPE samples, we show its
potential as both a robust clinical assay and a powerful discovery tool, which we
used to identify new therapeutically important gene fusions: ARHGEF2-NTRK1 and
CHTOP-NTRK1 in glioblastoma, MSN-ROS1, TRIM4-BRAF, VAMP2-NRG1, TPM3-NTRK1 and
RUFY2-RET in lung cancer, FGFR2-CREB5 in cholangiocarcinoma and PPL-NTRK1 in
thyroid carcinoma. AMP is a scalable and efficient next-generation sequencing
target enrichment method for research and clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) have been successfully isolated
from patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the self-renewal of
GCSCs and their relationship with the microenvironment are poorly characterized.
METHODS: GCSCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were cultured directly
from gastric cancer patients. The self-renewal of GCSCs was assayed by sphere
formation assay and in vivo tumorigenicity. Expression of neuregulin1 (NRG1) was 
examined by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and western blotting.
RESULTS: CAFs increased the self-renewal of GCSCs by secreting NRG1. NRG1
activated NF-κB signaling and this activation regulated GCSC self-renewal.
Moreover, NF-κB-active GCSCs were tumorigenic, however NF-κB-inactive GCSCs were 
not. The overexpression of NRG1 in stromal cells and cancer cells was observed in
the tumor tissues of gastric cancer patients and was associated with clinical
stage lymph node metastasis and survival in gastric cancer patients. In addition,
we also found that NRG1 can regulate the proliferation and invasion of gastric
cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that NRG1, which can be secreted by CAFs or
cancer cells, promotes progression of gastric cancer by regulating the
self-renewal of GCSCs and its overexpression is associated with a prognosis of
gastric cancer.

Artificial guidance channels containing Schwann cells can promote the
regeneration of injured peripheral nerve over long distances. However, primary
Schwann cells are not suitable for autotransplantation. Under specific
conditions, skin-derived progenitors can be induced to differentiate into Schwann
cells. Therefore, adult rat dorsal skin (dermis)-derived progenitors were
isolated and induced to differentiate with DMEM/F12 containing B27, neuregulin 1,
and forskolin. Immunofluorescence staining and reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed that the resultant cells were indeed Schwann
cells. Artificial guidance channels containing skin-derived progenitors, Schwann 
cells originating from skin-derived progenitors, or primary Schwann cells were
used to bridge 5 mm sciatic nerve defects. Schwann cells originating from
skin-derived progenitors significantly promoted sciatic nerve axonal
regeneration. The significant recovery of injured rat sciatic nerve function
after the transplantation of Schwann cells originating from skin-derived
progenitors was confirmed by electromyogram. The therapeutic effect of Schwann
cells originating from skin-derived progenitors was better than that of
skin-derived progenitors. These findings indicate that Schwann cells originating 
from skin-derived precursors can promote peripheral nerve regeneration in rats.

Neuregulin 1 type III is processed following regulated intramembrane proteolysis,
which allows communication from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. We found that
the intracellular domain of neuregulin 1 type III upregulated the prostaglandin
D2 synthase (L-pgds, also known as Ptgds) gene, which, together with the G
protein-coupled receptor Gpr44, forms a previously unknown pathway in PNS
myelination. Neuronal L-PGDS is secreted and produces the PGD2 prostanoid, a
ligand of Gpr44. We found that mice lacking L-PGDS were hypomyelinated.
Consistent with this, specific inhibition of L-PGDS activity impaired in vitro
myelination and caused myelin damage. Furthermore, in vivo ablation and in vitro 
knockdown of glial Gpr44 impaired myelination. Finally, we identified Nfatc4, a
key transcription factor for myelination, as one of the downstream effectors of
PGD2 activity in Schwann cells. Thus, L-PGDS and Gpr44 are previously unknown
components of an axo-glial interaction that controls PNS myelination and possibly
myelin maintenance.

In neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumor of childhood, excellent prognosis
is associated with extensive Schwann cell (SC) content and high-level expression 
of the neurotrophin receptor, NTRK1/TrkA, which is known to mediate neuroblastoma
cell differentiation. We hypothesized that both stromal composition and
neuroblastic differentiation are based on bidirectional neuroblastoma-SC
interaction. Reanalysis of microarray data from human SY5Y neuroblastoma cells
stably transfected with either NTRK1 or NTRK2 revealed upregulation of the mRNA
for the SC growth factor, NRG1, in NTRK1-positive cells. Media conditioned by
NTRK1-expressing neuroblastoma cells induced SC proliferation and migration,
while antibody-based NRG1 neutralization significantly decreased these effects.
Vice versa, NRG1-stimulated SC secreted the NTRK1-specific ligand, NGF.
SC-conditioned medium activated the NTRK1 receptor in a neuroblastoma cell
culture model conditionally expressing NTRK1 and induced differentiation markers 
in NTRK1-expressing cells. NTRK1 induction in neuroblastoma xenografts mixed with
primary SC also significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. We propose a model
for NTRK1-mediated and NRG1-dependent attraction of adjacent SC, which in turn
induce neuroblastic differentiation by secretion of the NTRK1-specific ligand,
NGF. These findings have implications for understanding the mature and less
malignant neuroblastoma phenotype associated with NTRK1 expression, and could
assist the development of new therapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma
differentiation.

Neuregulin1 (NRG1) is a single transmembrane protein that plays a critical role
in neural development and synaptic plasticity. Both NRG1 and its receptor, ErbB4,
are well-established risk genes of schizophrenia. The NRG1 ecto-domain (ED) binds
and activates ErbB4 following proteolytic cleavage of pro-NRG1 precursor protein.
Although several studies have addressed the function of NRG1 in brain, very
little is known about the cleavage and shedding mechanism. Here we show that the 
neuronal vesicular protein calcyon is a potent activator and key determinant of
NRG1 ED cleavage and shedding. Calcyon stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis
and endosomal targeting; and its levels are elevated in postmortem brains of
schizophrenics. Overexpression of calcyon stimulates NRG1 cleavage and signaling 
in vivo, and as a result, GABA transmission is enhanced in calcyon overexpressing
mice. Conversely, NRG1 cleavage, ErbB4 activity and GABA transmission are
decreased in calcyon null mice. Moreover, stimulation of NRG1 cleavage by calcyon
was recapitulated in HEK 293 cells suggesting the mechanism involved is
cell-autonomous. Finally, studies with site-specific mutants in calcyon and
inhibitors for the major sheddases indicate that the stimulatory effects of
calcyon on NRG1 cleavage and shedding depend on clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
β-secretase 1, and interaction with clathrin adaptor proteins. Together these
results identify a novel mechanism for NRG1 cleavage and shedding.

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute to breast cancer
progression by releasing soluble factors that sustain tumor progression. MSCs
express functional epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and breast cancer
cells secrete EGFR-ligands including transforming growth factor-α (TGFα). Using
RNA-sequencing, we analysed the whole transcriptome of MSCs stimulated with TGFα.
We identified 1,640 highly differentially regulated genes: 967 genes up-regulated
with Fold Induction (FI) ≥ 1.50 and 673 genes down-regulated with FI ≤ 0.50. When
highly regulated genes were categorized according to GO molecular function
classification and KEGG pathways analysis, a large number of genes coding for
potentially secreted proteins or surface receptors resulted enriched following
TGFα treatment, including VEGFA, IL6, EREG, HB-EGF, LIF, NGF, NRG1, CCL19, CCL2, 
CCL25 and CXCL3. Secretion of corresponding proteins was confirmed for selected
factors. Finally, we identified 4,377 and 4,262 alternatively spliced genes in
untreated and TGFα-treated MSCs, respectively. Among these, an unannotated splice
variant of VEGFA coding for a secreted VEGF protein of 172 amino acids
(VEGFA(172)), was found only in MSCs stimulated with TGFα. These findings suggest
that EGFR activation in MSCs leads to a significant change in the expression of a
wide array of genes coding for secreted proteins that can significantly enhance
tumor progression.

BACKGROUND: Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, is used to treat several
cancers. However, many patients who initially respond to cetuximab acquire
resistance. To examine mechanisms of acquired resistance, we developed a series
of cetuximab-resistant (Ctx(R)) clones derived from the cetuximab sensitive
(CtxS) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line H226. Previous studies
characterizing this model revealed that: 1) EGFR was robustly overexpressed in
Ctx(R) clones due to decreased EGFR ubiquitination and degradation and 2) Ctx(R) 
clones expressed increased HER2 and HER3 activation resulting in constitutive
activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling axis. These findings suggest that dual
targeting HER family receptors would be highly beneficial in the Ctx(R) setting.
RESULTS: Since HER3 has been implicated in resistance to EGFR inhibitors, the
efficacy of dually targeting both EGFR and HER3 in Ctx(R) models was evaluated.
First, EGFR and HER3 expression were knocked down with siRNAs. Compared to the
Ctx(S) parental cell line (HP), all Ctx(R) clones exhibited robust decreases in
cell proliferation upon dual knockdown. Analysis of Ctx(R) clones indicated that 
neuregulin-1 was highly overexpressed compared to HP cells. Incubation of HP
cells with neuregulin-1 rendered them resistant to cetuximab. Next, dual
treatment of Ctx(R) clones with cetuximab and the HER3 neutralizing monoclonal
antibody (mAb) U3-1287 led to potent anti-proliferative effects. Blockade of EGFR
with cetuximab resulted in inactivation of MAPK, while blockade of HER3 with
U3-1287 resulted in the inactivation of AKT. Treatment with both mAbs resulted in
knockdown of both signaling pathways simultaneously. HER2 was also strongly
inactivated upon dual mAb therapy, suggesting that this treatment regimen can
diminish signaling from three HER family receptors. De novo CtxR H226 mouse
xenografts were established to determine if dual therapy could overcome acquired 
resistance to cetuximab in vivo. Tumors that had acquired resistance to cetuximab
were significantly growth delayed upon dual treatment of U3-1287 and cetuximab
compared to those continued on cetuximab only. Combinatorial-treated xenograft
tumors expressed decreased Ki67 and increased cleaved caspase-3 levels compared
to tumors treated with either monotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that dually targeting HER family receptors
with antibody-based therapies can overcome acquired resistance to cetuximab.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve injury can result in neuropathic pain, a chronic
condition of unclear cause often poorly responsive to current treatments. One
possibility is that nerve injury disrupts large A-fiber-mediated inhibition of
C-fiber-evoked responses in spinal dorsal horn neurons, leading to central
sensitization. A recent study provided a potential molecular mechanism; large
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons secrete neuregulin-1 (NRG1), which binds to
erbB4 receptors on interneurons and promotes GABA release to inhibit
C-fiber-evoked nociceptive transmission. Thus, reduced NRG1 expression following 
nerve injury could induce chronic pain by disinhibition. We examined if DRG
expression of NRG1 is in fact reduced in a rat model of neuropathic pain and if
exogenous NRG1 alleviates behavioral signs of this condition.
METHODS: Three neuropathic pain models were established in rats: spared nerve
injury of the tibial and common peroneal nerves (SNI model), intraplantar
injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA model), and subcutaneous formalin
injection. NRG1 expression was assessed by immunofluorescent staining,
hyperalgesia by paw withdrawal threshold to von Frey filament stimulation, and
pain-like behavior by spontaneous flinching.
RESULTS: NRG1 protein immunoreactivity was reduced in the rat DRG after SNI.
Intrathecal administration of neuregulin-1beta 1 (NRG1-1), a 62 amino acid NRG1
mimetic, transiently increased paw withdrawal threshold in SNI model and reduced 
flinching in the formalin injection model.
CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with a model of neuropathic pain whereby
peripheral nerve injury reduces NRG1-mediated inhibition of nociceptive
signaling. Modulating NRG1 may have therapeutic potential for treating
neuropathic pain.

Genome-wide association studies have identified a wealth of genetic variants
involved in complex traits and multifactorial diseases. There is now considerable
interest in testing variants for association with multiple phenotypes
(pleiotropy) and for testing multiple variants for association with a single
phenotype (gene-based association tests). Such approaches can increase
statistical power by combining evidence for association over multiple phenotypes 
or genetic variants respectively. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) measures
the correlation between two sets of multidimensional variables, and thus offers
the potential to combine these two approaches. To apply CCA, we must restrict the
number of attributes relative to the number of samples. Hence we consider modules
of genetic variation that can comprise a gene, a pathway or another biologically 
relevant grouping, and/or a set of phenotypes. In order to do this, we use an
attribute selection strategy based on a binary genetic algorithm. Applied to a
UK-based prospective cohort study of 4286 women (the British Women's Heart and
Health Study), we find improved statistical power in the detection of previously 
reported genetic associations, and identify a number of novel pleiotropic
associations between genetic variants and phenotypes. New discoveries include
gene-based association of NSF with triglyceride levels and several genes (ACSM3, 
ERI2, IL18RAP, IL23RAP and NRG1) with left ventricular hypertrophy phenotypes. In
multiple-phenotype analyses we find association of NRG1 with left ventricular
hypertrophy phenotypes, fibrinogen and urea and pleiotropic relationships of F7
and F10 with Factor VII, Factor IX and cholesterol levels.

The receptor tyrosine kinase human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is
known to regulate pulmonary epithelial barrier function; however, the mechanisms 
behind this effect remain unidentified. We hypothesized that HER2 signaling
alters the epithelial barrier through an interaction with the adherens junction
(AJ) protein β-catenin, leading to dissolution of the AJ. In quiescent pulmonary 
epithelial cells, HER2 and β-catenin colocalized along the lateral intercellular 
junction. HER2 activation by the ligand neuregulin-1 was associated with tyrosine
phosphorylation of β-catenin, dissociation of β-catenin from E-cadherin, and
decreased E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. All effects were blocked with the
HER2 inhibitor lapatinib. β-Catenin knockdown using shRNA significantly
attenuated neuregulin-1-induced decreases in pulmonary epithelial resistance in
vitro. Our data indicate that HER2 interacts with β-catenin, leading to
dissolution of the AJ, decreased cell-cell adhesion, and disruption of the
pulmonary epithelial barrier.

Candida albicans, a major human fungal pathogen, is the primary cause of invasive
candidiasis in a wide array of immunocompromised patients. C. albicans virulence 
requires the ability to undergo a reversible morphological transition from yeast 
to filaments in response to a variety of host environmental cues. These cues are 
sensed by the pathogen and activate multiple signal transduction pathways to
induce filamentation. Reversible phosphorylation events are critical for
regulation of many of these pathways. While a variety of protein kinases are
known to function as components of C. albicans filamentous growth signal
transduction pathways, considerably little is known about the role of
phosphatases. Here we demonstrate that PPG1, encoding a putative type 2A-related 
protein phosphatase, is important for C. albicans filament extension, invasion,
and virulence in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. PPG1 is also important
for downregulation of NRG1, a key transcriptional repressor of C. albicans
filamentous growth, and is shown to affect the expression of several
filament-specific target genes. An epistasis analysis suggests that PPG1 controls
C. albicans filamentation via the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA)
signaling pathway. We demonstrate that Ppg1 possesses phosphatase activity and
that a ppg1 catalytic mutant shows nearly equivalent filamentation, invasion, and
virulence defects compared to those of a ppg1Δ/Δ strain. Overall, our results
suggest that phosphatases, such as Ppg1, play critical roles in controlling and
fine-tuning C. albicans filament extension and virulence as well as signal
transduction pathways, transcriptional regulators, and target genes associated
with these processes.

Schizophrenia is thought to arise due to a complex interaction between genetic
and environmental factors during early neurodevelopment. We have recently shown
that partial genetic deletion of the schizophrenia susceptibility gene neuregulin
1 (Nrg1) and adolescent stress interact to disturb sensorimotor gating,
neuroendocrine activity and dendritic morphology in mice. Both stress and Nrg1
may have converging effects upon N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) which
are implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, sensorimotor gating and
dendritic spine plasticity. Using an identical repeated restraint stress paradigm
to our previous study, here we determined NMDAR binding across various brain
regions in adolescent Nrg1 heterozygous (HET) and wild-type (WT) mice using
[(3)H] MK-801 autoradiography. Repeated restraint stress increased NMDAR binding 
in the ventral part of the lateral septum (LSV) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the
hippocampus irrespective of genotype. Partial genetic deletion of Nrg1 interacted
with adolescent stress to promote an altered pattern of NMDAR binding in the
infralimbic (IL) subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex. In the IL, whilst
stress tended to increase NMDAR binding in WT mice, it decreased binding in Nrg1 
HET mice. However, in the DG, stress selectively increased the expression of
NMDAR binding in Nrg1 HET mice but not WT mice. These results demonstrate a
Nrg1-stress interaction during adolescence on NMDAR binding in the medial
prefrontal cortex.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital and heterogeneous disorder
characterized by the absence of intramural nervous plexuses along variable
lengths of the hindgut. Although RET is a well-established risk factor, a recent 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HSCR has identified NRG1 as an additional
susceptibility locus. To discover additional risk loci, we performed a GWAS of
123 sporadic HSCR patients and 432 unaffected controls using a large-scale
platform with coverage of over 1 million polymorphic markers. The result was that
our study replicated the findings of RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A genomic region
(rawP = 5.69×10(-19) before a Bonferroni correction; corrP = 4.31×10(-13) after a
Bonferroni correction) and NRG1 as susceptibility loci. In addition, this study
identified SLC6A20 (adjP = 2.71×10(-6)), RORA (adjP = 1.26×10(-5)), and ABCC9
(adjP = 1.86×10(-5)) as new potential susceptibility loci under adjusting the
already known loci on the RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A and NRG1 regions, although none
of the SNPs in these genes passed the Bonferroni correction. In further subgroup 
analysis, the RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A genomic region was observed to have
different significance levels among subgroups: short-segment (S-HSCR,
corrP = 1.71×10(-5)), long-segment (L-HSCR, corrP = 6.66×10(-4)), and total
colonic aganglionosis (TCA, corrP>0.05). This differential pattern in the
significance level suggests that other genomic loci or mechanisms may affect the 
length of aganglionosis in HSCR subgroups during enteric nervous system (ENS)
development. Although functional evaluations are needed, our findings might
facilitate improved understanding of the mechanisms of HSCR pathogenesis.

Anxiety disorder is related to the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases,
including major depression, substance abuse, and schizophrenia. The amygdala is
important for manifestation and modulation of anxiety. However, relatively little
is known regarding the mechanisms that control the amygdala inhibitory activity
that is involved in anxiety. We found that almost all ErbB4, which is the only
autonomous receptor of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), was
expressed in GABAergic neurons. Endogenous NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway in the
BLA could modulate anxiety-like behaviors and GABA release, whereas it had no
effect on glutamatergic transmission. The administration of NRG1 into the BLA of 
high-anxiety mice alleviated their anxiety and enhanced GABAergic
neurotransmission. Moreover, exogenous NRG1 also produced an anxiolytic effect in
the stressed mice. Together, these observations indicated that NRG1-ErbB4
signaling is critical to maintaining GABAergic activity in the amygdala and thus 
to modulating anxiety-like behaviors. Because NRG1 and ErbB4 are susceptibility
genes of schizophrenia, our findings might also help to explain the potential
mechanism of emotional abnormality in schizophrenia.

Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ErbB4 are schizophrenia risk genes.
NRG1-ErbB4 signaling plays a critical role in neural development and regulates
neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, its cellular targets
remain controversial. ErbB4 was thought to express in excitatory neurons,
although recent studies disputed this view. Using mice that express a fluorescent
protein under the promoter of the ErbB4 gene, we determined in what cells ErbB4
is expressed and their identity. ErbB4 was widely expressed in the mouse brain,
being highest in amygdala and cortex. Almost all ErbB4-positive cells were
GABAergic in cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and most of amygdala in neonatal
and adult mice, suggesting GABAergic transmission as a major target of NRG1-ErbB4
signaling in these regions. Non-GABAergic, ErbB4-positive cells were present in
thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain. In particular, ErbB4 is
expressed in serotoninergic neurons of raphe nuclei but not in norepinephrinergic
neurons of the locus ceruleus. In hypothalamus, ErbB4 is present in neurons that 
express oxytocin. Finally, ErbB4 is expressed in a group of cells in the
subcortical areas that are positive for S100 calcium binding protein β. These
results identify novel cellular targets of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two main high-affinity inorganic phosphate
(Pi) transporters, Pho84 and Pho89, that are functionally relevant at
acidic/neutral pH and alkaline pH, respectively. Upon Pi starvation, PHO84 and
PHO89 are induced by the activation of the PHO regulon by the binding of the Pho4
transcription factor to specific promoter sequences. We show that PHO89 and PHO84
are induced by alkalinization of the medium with different kinetics and that the 
network controlling Pho89 expression in response to alkaline pH differs from that
of other members of the PHO regulon. In addition to Pho4, the PHO89 promoter is
regulated by the transcriptional activator Crz1 through the calcium-activated
phosphatase calcineurin, and it is under the control of several repressors (Mig2,
Nrg1, and Nrg2) coordinately regulated by the Snf1 protein kinase and the Rim101 
transcription factor. This network mimics the one regulating expression of the
Na(+)-ATPase gene ENA1, encoding a major determinant for Na(+) detoxification.
Our data highlight a scenario in which the activities of Pho89 and Ena1 are
functionally coordinated to sustain growth in an alkaline environment.

Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a trophic factor that has an essential role in the nervous
system by modulating neurodevelopment, neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.
Despite the evidence that NRG1 and its receptors, ErbB tyrosine kinases, are
expressed in mesencephalic dopaminergic nuclei and their functional alterations
are reported in schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, the role of NRG1/ErbB
signalling in dopaminergic neurons remains unclear. Here we found that NRG1
selectively increases the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1)-activated
currents by inducing synthesis and trafficking to membrane of functional
receptors and stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of
rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathway, which is required for mGluR1 function.
Notably, an endogenous NRG1/ErbB tone is necessary to maintain mGluR1 function,
by preserving its surface membrane expression in dopaminergic neurons.
Consequently, it enables striatal mGluR1-induced dopamine outflow in in vivo
conditions. Our results identify a novel role of NRG1 in the dopaminergic
neurons, whose functional alteration might contribute to devastating diseases,
such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

The fungus Candida albicans is a benign member of the mucosal microbiota, but can
cause mucosal infections and life-threatening disseminated invasive infections in
susceptible individuals. The ability to switch between yeast, pseudohyphal, and
hyphal growth forms (polymorphism) is one of the most investigated virulence
attributes of C. albicans. Recent studies suggest that hyphal development in C.
albicans requires two temporally linked regulations for initiation and
maintenance of the hyphal transcriptional program. Hyphal initiation requires a
rapid but temporary disappearance of the Nrg1 transcriptional repressor of hyphal
morphogenesis. Hyphal maintenance requires active sensing of the surrounding
environment, leading to exclusion of Nrg1 binding to promoters of hypha-specific 
genes or reduced NRG1 expression. We discuss recent advances in understanding the
complex transcriptional regulation of hyphal gene expression. These provide
molecular mechanisms underpinning the phenotypic plasticity of C. albicans
polymorphism.

Alterations in the signaling pathways of epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs)
are associated with tumor aggressiveness. Neurotensin (NTS) and its high affinity
receptor (NTSR1) are up regulated in 60% of lung cancers. In a previous clinical 
study, NTSR1 overexpression was shown to predict a poor prognosis for 5 year
overall survival in a selected population of stage I lung adenocarcinomas treated
by surgery alone. In a second study, shown here, the frequent and high expression
of NTSR1 was correlated with a pejorative prognosis in 389 patients with stage I 
to III lung adenocarcinoma, and was an independent prognosis marker. Interactions
between NTS and NTSR1 induce pro-oncogenic biological effects associated with
neoplastic processes and tumor progression. Here we highlight the cellular
mechanisms activated by Neurotensin (NTS) and its high affinity receptor (NTSR1) 
contributing to lung cancer cell aggressiveness. We show that the NTS autocrine
and/or paracrine regulation causes EGFR, HER2, and HER3 over-expression and
activation in lung tumor cells. The EGFR and HER3 autocrine activation is
mediated by MMP1 activation and EGF "like" ligands (HB-EGF, Neuregulin 1)
release. By establishing autocrine and/or paracrine NTS regulation, we show that 
tumor growth is modulated according to NTS expression, with a low growth rate in 
those tumors that do not express NTS. Accordingly, xenografted tumors expressing 
NTS and NTSR1 showed a positive response to erlotinib, whereas tumors void of
NTSR1 expression had no detectable response. This is consistent with the presence
of a NTS autocrine loop, leading to the sustained activation of EGFR and
responsible for cancer aggressiveness. We propose the use of NTS/NTSR1 tumor
expression, as a biomarker for the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in
patients lacking EGFR mutation.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rim101 is a member of the fungal PacC family of
transcription factors involved in the response to alkaline pH stress. Further
studies have also implicated Rim101 in the responses to other stresses, and have 
shown its genetic interaction with the iron deprivation-responsive factor Aft1.
The present study shows that the absence of Rim101 leads to hypersensitivity to
oxidants such as t-butyl hydroperoxide and diamide, and also to the prooxidant
agent selenite. The protective role of Rim101 against selenite requires the
sensing complex component Rim8, the ESCRT-I/II/III complexes and the Rim13
protease involved in proteolytic activation of Rim101. The Nrg1 transcriptional
repressor is a downstream effector of Rim101 in this response to selenite, as
occurs in the responses to alkaline pH, Na(+) and Li(+) stresses. Deletion of
RIM101 causes downregulation of the vacuolar ATPase genes VMA2 and VMA4, which
becomes accentuated compared to wild type cells upon selenite stress, and
activation of the Rim101 protein prevents inhibition of vacuolar acidification
caused by selenite. These observations therefore support a role of Rim101 in
modulation of vacuolar acidity necessary for selenite detoxification. In
addition, a parallel Rim101-independent pathway requiring the complete ESCRT
machinery (including the ESCRT-0 complex) also participates in protection against
selenite.

In head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), four intrinsic subtypes (or
groups) have been identified, and each one possesses a unique biology that will
require specific treatment strategies. We previously reported that mesenchymal
(group 2) tumors exhibit reduced levels of Trop2 expression. In this study, we
investigated the functional role of Trop2 in HNSCC and find that loss results in 
autocrine activation of the EGFR family member ErbB3 via neuregulin-1. Trop2
localizes to both the cell surface and cytosol of HNSCC cells and forms a complex
with neuregulin-1, which is predominantly cytosolic. Inactivation of Trop2
increases the concentration of neuregulin-1 at the cell surface where it is
cleaved to activate ErbB3. In primary HNSCC, detection of ErbB3 activation was
limited to Trop2 negative tumors. An analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
HNSCC dataset confirms enrichment for ErbB3 activity in mesenchymal tumors.
Notably, Trop2 loss triggers sensitivity to anti-ErbB3 antibodies, which results 
in reduced proliferation and tumorigenic growth of Trop2 negative HNSCC cancer
cells. These results uncover a molecular mechanism by which tumor cells control
the amount of cell-surface neuregulin-1 available for cleavage and ErbB3
activation. Moreover, we demonstrate that Trop2 is a potential surrogate
biomarker to identify tumors with ErbB3 activation and may therefore respond to
anti-ErbB3 therapeutics.

The myelin sheath insulates neuronal axons and markedly increases the nerve
conduction velocity. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cell
precursors migrate along embryonic neuronal axons to their final destinations,
where they eventually wrap around individual axons to form the myelin sheath
after birth. ErbB2 and ErbB3 tyrosine kinase receptors form a heterodimer and are
extensively expressed in Schwann lineage cells. ErbB2/3 is thought to be one of
the primary regulators controlling the entire Schwann cell development. ErbB3 is 
the bona fide Schwann cell receptor for the neuronal ligand neuregulin-1.
Although ErbB2/3 is well known to regulate both Schwann cell precursor migration 
and myelination by Schwann cells in fishes, it still remains unclear whether in
mammals, ErbB2/3 actually regulates Schwann cell precursor migration. Here, we
show that knockdown of ErbB3 using a Schwann cell-specific promoter in mice
causes delayed migration of Schwann cell precursors. In contrast, littermate
control mice display normal migration. Similar results are seen in an in vitro
migration assay using reaggregated Schwann cell precursors. Also, ErbB3 knockdown
in mice reduces myelin thickness in sciatic nerves, consistent with the
established role of ErbB3 in myelination. Thus, ErbB3 plays a key role in
migration, as well as in myelination, in mouse Schwann lineage cells, presenting 
a genetically conservative role of ErbB3 in Schwann cell precursor migration.

Epidemiological studies suggest that perinatal complications, particularly
hypoxia-related ones, increase the risk of schizophrenia. Recent genetic studies 
of the disorder have identified several putative susceptibility genes, some of
which are known to be regulated by hypoxia. It can be postulated therefore that
birth complications that cause hypoxia in the fetal brain may be associated with 
a dysregulation in the expression of some of the schizophrenia candidate genes.
To test this, we used an animal model of perinatal asphyxia, in which rat pups
were exposed to 15 min of intrauterine anoxia during Caesarean section birth, and
examined the expression of mRNA of five of the putative susceptibility genes
(NRG1, ErbB4, AKT1, COMT and BDNF) by real-time quantitative PCR in the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus at 6 and 12 weeks after birth. The
expression of NRG1 mRNA was significantly decreased in the mPFC, but not in the
hippocampus, at 6 and 12 weeks after birth. In addition, a significant increase
in COMT mRNA expression was observed in the mPFC at 12 weeks. The alteration in
mRNA levels of NRG1 and COMT was not associated with a change in their protein
levels. These results suggest that perinatal asphyxia may lead to disturbances in
the PFC, which in turn may exert a long-lasting influence on the expression of
specific genes, such as NRG1 and COMT. Our results also suggest that
translational interruption may occur in this model of perinatal asphyxia.

BACKGROUND: Spinal microglia activation is one of the pathologic mechanisms
involved in post-operative pain, which results from surgical injuries in skin,
fascia, muscle and small nerves innervating these tissues. Recent research has
shown that neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and its receptor erythroblastosis oncogene B
(ErbB) family mediate microglia proliferation and chemotaxis contributing to the 
development of neuropathic pain. However, it is unclear whether NRG1-ErbB
signalling contributes to incision-induced mechanical allodynia.
METHODS: Expressions of NRG1, ErbB2 and activation of microglia in spinal cord
following paw plantar incision in an incision-induced mechanical allodynia model 
were detected with real-time PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.
Altered mechanical pain and spinal microglia activation were observed by
pharmacologically blocking of NRG1-ErbB signalling or down-regulation of NRG1
types I and II via small interfering RNA (siRNA) intervention.
RESULTS: NRG1-ErbB signalling mediated incision-induced microglia activation and 
mechanical allodynia. Expressions of types I and II NRG1 in L5 dorsal root
ganglion at RNA level and in spinal cord at protein level were dramatically
increased after paw incision. Pharmacologically blocking of NRG1-ErbB signalling 
by ErbB inhibitor and down-regulation, the expression of NRG1 types I and II via 
siRNA suppressed incision-induced microglia activation and alleviated mechanical 
allodynia.
CONCLUSION: Incision-induced NRG1 expression mediated activation of dorsal horn
microglia and contributed to the development of mechanical allodynia.
Specifically targeting NRG1-ErbB signalling may therefore provide a new
therapeutic intervention for relieving incision-induced mechanical allodynia.

Duplication of the gene encoding the peripheral myelin protein of 22 kDa (PMP22) 
underlies the most common inherited neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT1A), a
disease without a known cure. Although demyelination represents a characteristic 
feature, the clinical phenotype of CMT1A is determined by the degree of axonal
loss, and patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness and impaired
sensation. CMT1A disease manifests within the first two decades of life, and
walking disabilities, foot deformities and electrophysiological abnormalities are
already present in childhood. Here, we show in Pmp22-transgenic rodent models of 
CMT1A that Schwann cells acquire a persistent differentiation defect during early
postnatal development, caused by imbalanced activity of the PI3K-Akt and the
Mek-Erk signaling pathways. We demonstrate that enhanced PI3K-Akt signaling by
axonally overexpressed neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type I drives diseased Schwann cells
toward differentiation and preserves peripheral nerve axons. Notably, in a
preclinical experimental therapy using a CMT1A rat model, when treatment is
restricted to early postnatal development, soluble NRG1 effectively overcomes
impaired peripheral nerve development and restores axon survival into adulthood. 
Our findings suggest a model in which Schwann cell differentiation within a
limited time window is crucial for the long-term maintenance of axonal support.

Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 
(ErbB4) have been extensively studied in schizophrenia susceptibility because of 
their pivotal role in key neurodevelopmental processes. One of the reasons for
the inconsistencies in results could be the fact that the phenotype investigated 
has mostly the diagnosis of schizophrenia per se, which is widely heterogeneous, 
both clinically and biologically. In the present study we tested, in a large
cohort of 461 schizophrenia patients recruited in Scotland, whether several SNPs 
in NRG1 and/or ErbB4 are associated with schizophrenia symptom dimensions as
evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We then followed
up nominally significant results in a second cohort of 439 schizophrenia subjects
recruited in Germany. Using linear regression, we observed two different groups
of polymorphisms in NRG1 gene: one showing a nominal association with higher
scores of the PANSS positive dimension and the other one with higher scores of
the PANSS negative dimension. Regarding ErbB4, a small cluster located in the 5' 
end of the gene was detected, showing nominal association mainly with negative,
general and total dimensions of the PANSS. These findings suggest that some
regions of NRG1 and ErbB4 are functionally involved in biological processes that 
underlie some of the phenotypic manifestations of schizophrenia. Because of the
lack of significant association after correction for multiple testing, our
analyses should be considered as exploratory and hypothesis generating for future
studies.

Ovarian cancer is the first in mortalities among gynecologic cancers in the
United States, often due to late diagnosis and/or acquired platinum-resistant
recurrences. This study investigates whether BRCA1-IRIS is a novel treatment
target for ovarian cancers and in platinum-resistant recurrences. Here we show
that more than half of the ovarian cancer samples analyzed showed BRCA1-IRIS and 
survivin overexpression and lacked nuclear FOXO3a expression. Normal ovarian
epithelial cells overexpressing BRCA1-IRIS formed metastasis in mice when
injected in the peritoneal cavity, whereas aggressive ovarian cancer cell lines
failed to form tumors or metastases in mice when BRCA1-IRIS was silenced in them.
We show that BRCA1-IRIS activates two autocrine signaling loops, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor/tyrosine kinase B receptor (BDNF/TrkB) and neuregulin 1
(NRG1)/ErbB2. These loops are involved in anoikis resistance and metastasis
promotion. These loops operate in several ovarian cancer cell lines, and
BRCA1-IRIS silencing or inactivation using a novel inhibitory peptide renders
both non-functional and promoted cell death. In a mouse xenograft model,
BRCA1-IRIS inactivation using this novel inhibitory peptide resulted in
significant reduction in ovarian tumor growth. More importantly, this treatment
sensitized ovarian tumors to low cisplatin concentrations. Taken together, these 
data strongly suggest that BRCA1-IRIS and/or BDNF/TrkB and NRG1/ErbB2 could serve
as rational therapeutic targets for advanced ovarian cancers.

Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) gene variants are associated with increased genetic risk for 
schizophrenia. It is unclear whether risk haplotypes cause elevated or decreased 
expression of NRG1 in the brains of schizophrenia patients, given that both
findings have been reported from autopsy studies. To study NRG1 functions in
vivo, we generated mouse mutants with reduced and elevated NRG1 levels and
analyzed the impact on cortical functions. Loss of NRG1 from cortical projection 
neurons resulted in increased inhibitory neurotransmission, reduced synaptic
plasticity, and hypoactivity. Neuronal overexpression of cysteine-rich domain
(CRD)-NRG1, the major brain isoform, caused unbalanced excitatory-inhibitory
neurotransmission, reduced synaptic plasticity, abnormal spine growth, altered
steady-state levels of synaptic plasticity-related proteins, and impaired
sensorimotor gating. We conclude that an "optimal" level of NRG1 signaling
balances excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the cortex. Our data
provide a potential pathomechanism for impaired synaptic plasticity and suggest
that human NRG1 risk haplotypes exert a gain-of-function effect.

Exceptional longevity (EL) is a rare phenotype that can cluster in families, and 
co-segregation of genetic variation in these families may point to candidate
genes that could contribute to extended lifespan. In this study, for the first
time, we have sequenced a total of seven exomes from exceptionally long-lived
siblings (probands ≥ 103 years and at least one sibling ≥ 97 years) that come
from three separate families. We have focused on rare functional variants (RFVs) 
which have ≤ 1% minor allele frequency according to databases and that are likely
to alter gene product function. Based on this, we have identified one candidate
longevity gene carrying RFVs in all three families, APOB. Interestingly, APOB is 
a component of lipoprotein particles together with APOE, and variants in the
genes encoding these two proteins have been previously associated with human
longevity. Analysis of nonfamilial EL cases showed a trend, without reaching
statistical significance, toward enrichment of APOB RFVs. We have also identified
candidate longevity genes shared between two families (5-13) or within individual
families (66-156 genes). Some of these genes have been previously linked to
longevity in model organisms, such as PPARGC1A, NRG1, RAD52, RAD51, NCOR1, and
ADCY5 genes. This work provides an initial catalog of genes that could contribute
to exceptional familial longevity.

The Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene has been associated with schizophrenia in several
populations, and all four types of NRG1 genes are linked with neurotransmitters
activities. In this study for the first time we have demonstrated an association 
between NRG1 mutation and schizophrenia in Pakistani population. We examined the 
relationship of three genetic variants SNPs: rs3924999, rs2954041 and rs35753505 
of NRG1 gene with the onset of disease. Genomic DNA samples were obtained from
the blood of 100 patients and 80 matched controls. All three NRG1 SNPs were
genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
method and further confirmed by DNA sequencing. The SNPs frequencies were
estimated by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Chi-square tests. Our study
established a significant association of rs35753505 with schizophrenia but no
association with rs3924999 and rs2954041. The frequency of risk allele C was
significantly higher (62.5%) in rs35753505 patients when compared to controls
(28.13%). Genotype frequency by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for SNPrs3924999 in
patients was GG 77.4%, GA 21.12% and AA 1.44% and showed no association with the 
disease. Similarly, no genotype association was observed in rs2954041: GG 92.98%,
GT 6.89%, TT 0.13% of NRG1. However, one unexpected G allele, 100% guanine (G)
with no adenine (A) was found to be present in SNP rs35753505 in both patients
and controls. This is an interesting finding that both cohorts display only
allele G peak but no peak for allele A in the electropherogram for this SNP. Our 
results suggest that SNP rs35753505 of NRG1 plays an important role in conferring
susceptibility to the schizophrenia in a Pakistani population.

Transient overexposure of neuregulin 3 during early postnatal development impacts
selective behaviors in adulthood.

Neuregulin 3 (NRG3), a specific ligand for ErbB4 and a neuronal-enriched
neurotrophin is implicated in the genetic predisposition to a broad spectrum of
neurodevelopmental, neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, including
Alzheimer's disease, autism and schizophrenia. Genetic studies in schizophrenia
demonstrate that risk variants in NRG3 are associated with cognitive and
psychotic symptom severity, accompanied by increased expression of prefrontal
cortical NRG3. Despite our expanding knowledge of genetic involvement of NRG3 in 
neurological disorders, little is known about the neurodevelopmental mechanisms
of risk. Here we exploited the fact that a paralog of NRG3, NRG1, readily
penetrates the murine blood brain barrier (BBB). In this study we synthesized the
bioactive epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of NRG3, and using previously
validated in-vivo peripheral injection methodologies in neonatal mice,
demonstrate that NRG3 successfully crosses the BBB, where it activates its
receptor ErbB4 and downstream Akt signaling at levels of bioactivity comparable
to NRG1. To determine the impact of NRG3 overexpression during one critical
developmental window, C57BL/6 male mice were subcutaneously injected daily with
NRG1-EGF, NRG3-EGF or vehicle from postnatal days 2-10. Mice were tested in
adulthood using a comprehensive battery of behavioral tasks relevant to
neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders. In agreement with previous studies,
developmental overexposure to NRG1 induced multiple non-CNS mediated peripheral
effects as well as severely disrupting performance of prepulse inhibition of the 
startle response. In contrast, NRG3 had no effect on any peripheral measures
investigated or sensorimotor gating. Specifically, developmental NRG3
overexposure produced an anxiogenic-like phenotype and deficits in social
behavior in adulthood. These results provide primary data to support a role for
NRG3 in brain development and function, which appears to be distinct from its
paralog NRG1. Furthermore we demonstrate how perturbations in NRG3 expression at 
distinct developmental stages may contribute to the neurological deficits
observed in brain disorders such as schizophrenia and autism.

Neuregulin-1 increases connexin-40 and connexin-45 expression in embryonic stem
cell-derived cardiomyocytes.

Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a vital factor involved in heart development. NRG-1
up-regulated connexin-40 (Cx40) in mice fetal cardiomyocytes has been reported,
while the effect of NRG-1 on expression of connexins in embryonic stem
cells-derived cardiomyocytes (ESCMs) is limited studied. The process of
cardiomyocytes differentiated from embryonic stem cells with or without NRG-1
treatment was observed continuously. Exposure to NRG-1 increased the expression
of Cx40 and connexin-45 (Cx45) in ESCMs, while the expression of connexin-43 was 
unchanged regardless of NRG-1 treatment Western blot analysis also confirmed that
the expression of Cx40 and Cx45 in the beating foci was increased in the presence
of NRG-1. These results indicate that connexins are differentially regulated by
exogenous NRG-1 during cardiomyocytic differentiation of embryonic stem cells.

Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) signaling through the tyrosine kinase receptors erbB2 and
erbB4 is required for cardiac morphogenesis, and it plays an essential role in
maintaining the myocardial architecture during adulthood. The tyrosine kinase
receptor erbB2 was first linked to the amplification and overexpression of erbb2 
gene in a subtype of breast tumor cells, which is indicative of highly
proliferative cells and likely a poor prognosis following conventional
chemotherapy. The development of targeted therapies to block the survival of
erbB2-positive cancer cells revealed that impaired NRG1 signaling through
erbB2/erbB4 heterodimers combined with anthracycline chemotherapy may lead to
dilated cardiomyopathy in a subpopulation of treated patients. The
ventricular-specific deletion of either erbb2 or erbb4 manifested dilated
cardiomyopathy, which is aggravated by the administration of doxorubicin. Based
on the exacerbated toxicity displayed by the combined treatment, it is expected
that the relevant pathways would be affected in a synergistic manner. This review
examines the NRG1 activities that were monitored in different model systems,
focusing on the emerging pathways and molecular targets, which may aid in
understanding the acquired dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs under the
conditions of NRG1-deficient signaling.

TrkB interacts with ErbB4 and regulates NRG1-induced NR2B phosphorylation in
cortical neurons before synaptogenesis.

Pandya CD, Pillai A.

BACKGROUND: Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and NMDARs play important roles in various
neuronal functions including neural development. NMDARs also promote many
cellular events such as proliferation and survival of neuroblasts before synapse 
formation. Although many recent studies have indicated that NRG1 regulates NMDAR 
function in cortical neurons, the effect of NRG1 on NMDAR activation before
synapse formation is not well studied.
RESULTS: NRG1 induces activation of NMDAR subunit NR2B, and tropomyosin-related
kinase receptor B (TrkB), the receptor for BDNF via activation of phospholipase
C-gamma (PLC-γ) in immature primary cortical neurons. Our data using TrkB
inhibitor (K252a), TrkB siRNA and TrkB-/- neurons demonstrated that TrkB
inhibition suppresses NRG1-induced NR2B activation in neurons. We found that NRG1
stimulation leads to GABAA receptor-mediated TrkB activation.
Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligase assay showed that TrkB interacts with
ErbB4 (NRG1 receptor) and the TrkB-ErbB4 interaction was increased following NRG1
treatment. A significant reduction in TrkB-ErbB4 interaction was observed in the 
prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects. We found significant increase in
released BDNF levels following NRG1 treatment, which was inhibited by ErbB4
inhibitor, AG1478. In addition, pretreatment with BDNF neutralizing antibody, but
not control IgG abolished NRG1-induced increases in phospho-TrkB and phospho-NR2B
levels. Moreover, studies using TrkB mutants showed that intercellular domain of 
TrkB is necessary for TrkB-ErbB4 interaction and NR2B activation.
CONCLUSIONS: BDNF/TrkB signaling plays an important role in the NRG1-stimulated
NR2B regulation. These findings could be of relevance to many neurodevelopmental 
disorders, as NRG1 and BDNF signaling pathways have been implicated in autism and
schizophrenia.

Genome-wide association and network analysis of lung function in the Framingham
Heart Study.

Liao SY(1), Lin X, Christiani DC.

(1)Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of
America.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been found to be associated with pulmonary
function using genome-wide association studies. However, lung function is a
complex trait that is likely to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions 
besides individual genes. Our goal is to build a cellular network to explore the 
relationship between pulmonary function and genotypes by combining SNP level and 
network analyses using longitudinal lung function data from the Framingham Heart 
Study. We analyzed 2,698 genotyped participants from the Offspring cohort that
had an average of 3.35 spirometry measurements per person for a mean length of 13
years. Repeated forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 ) and the ratio of
FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) were used as outcomes. Data were analyzed
using linear-mixed models for the association between lung function and alleles
by accounting for the correlation among repeated measures over time within the
same subject and within-family correlation. Network analyses were performed using
dmGWAS and validated with data from the Third Generation cohort. Analyses
identified SMAD3, TGFBR2, CD44, CTGF, VCAN, CTNNB1, SCGB1A1, PDE4D, NRG1, EPHB1, 
and LYN as contributors to pulmonary function. Most of these genes were novel
that were not found previously using solely SNP-level analysis. These novel genes
are involving the transforming growth factor beta (TGFB)-SMAD pathway,
Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, etc. Therefore, combining SNP-level and network

CREB1 is a cAMP responsive transcriptional factor which plays a key role in
neural development. CREB1 signal pathway (CSP) has been implicated repeatedly in 
studies of predisposition for schizophrenia. We speculated that CSP has undergone
positive selection during evolution of modern human and some genes that have
undergone natural selection in the past may predispose to schizophrenia (SCZ) in 
modern time. Positive selection and association analysis were employed to explore
the molecular evolution of CSP and association with schizophrenia. Our results
showed a pan-ethnic selection event on NRG1 and CREB1, as confirmed in all 14
ethnic populations studied, which also suggested a selection process occurred
before the "Out of Africa" scenario. Analysis of 62 SNPs covering 6 CSP genes in 
2019 Han Chinese (976 SCZ patients and 1043 healthy individuals) showed an
association of two SNPs (rs4379857, P = 0.009, OR [95% CI]: 1.200 [1.379-1.046]; 
rs2238751, P = 0.023, OR [95% CI]: 1.253 [1.522-1.032]) with SCZ. However, none
of these significances survived after multiple testing corrections. Nonetheless, 
we observed an association of a rare CREB1 haplotype CCGGC (Bonferroni corrected 
P = 1.74 × 10(-5)) with SCZ. Our study showed that there was substantial
population heterogeneity in genetic predisposition to SCZ, and different genes in
the CSP pathway may predispose to SCZ in different populations.

Multiple genetic risk variants may act in a convergent manner leading on to the
pathophysiological alterations of brain structure and function in schizophrenia. 
We examined the effect of polymorphisms of two candidate genes that mediate
glutamatergic signaling, viz., dysbindin (rs1011313) and neuregulin (rs35753505),
on brain morphometry in patients with schizophrenia (N=38) and healthy subjects
(N=37) from South India. Patients with schizophrenia showed trend-level (p<0.001 
uncorrected, 20 voxel extent correction) volumetric reductions in multiple brain 
regions when compared to healthy control subjects. Trend-level volumetric
differences were also noted between homozygotes of the risk allele (AA) of the
neuregulin (NRG1) polymorphism and heterozygotes (AG), as well as homozygotes of 
the risk allele (CC) of the dysbindin (DTNBP1) polymorphism and heterozygotes
(TC), irrespective of diagnosis. Moreover, an additive effect of the risk alleles
on brain morphometry was also noted. These preliminary findings highlight the
possible influence of polymorphisms of risk genes on brain morphometry in
schizophrenia.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the rat neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)
protein in reducing doxorubicin (DOX)-induced myocardial toxicity and its
underlying mechanism. The prokaryotic expression of the NRG-1 protein and the
CCK8-determined activity of rat primary myocardial cells were evaluated under
different DOX concentrations. Myocardial cells were divided into three groups:
the control group, the 5 μM DOX (DOX5) group, and the DOX5+NRG-1 group. Western
blotting was used to determine the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX-1) and cardiac myosin 
light-chain kinase (cMLCK) protein expression levels and real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction methods were used to determine the mRNA expression
levels. The prokaryotic expression of NRG-1 in the DOX5 group produced toxicity
in the rat myocardial cells, and cell activity was significantly restored with
the addition of NRG-1. The protective effect of NRG-1 was limited at higher DOX
concentrations (DOX10), and the degree of cellular activity restoration was
positively correlated with NRG-1 concentration. The addition of NRG-1 to DOX5
intervention inhibited NCX-1 protein and mRNA expression, and increased cMLCK
protein and mRNA expression. In conclusion, DOX-induced toxicity in rat
myocardial cells could be protected by NRG-1, and the mechanism may be related to
the role of NRG-1 in up-regulating the cMLCK expression level and down-regulating
the NCX-1 expression level.

ERBB3/HER3 expression and signaling are upregulated in mutant BRAF melanoma as an
adaptive, prosurvival response to FDA-approved RAF inhibitors. Because
compensatory ERBB3 signaling counteracts the effects of RAF inhibitors,
cotargeting ERBB3 may increase the efficacy of RAF inhibitors in mutant BRAF
models of melanoma. Here, we corroborate this concept by showing that the ERBB3
function-blocking monoclonal antibody huHER3-8 can inhibit neuregulin-1
activation of ERBB3 and downstream signaling in RAF-inhibited melanoma cells.
Targeting mutant BRAF in combination with huHER3-8 decreased cell proliferation
and increased cell death in vitro, and decreased tumor burden in vivo, compared
with targeting either mutant BRAF or ERBB3 alone. Furthermore, the likelihood of 
a durable tumor response in vivo was increased when huHER3-8 was combined with
RAF inhibitor PLX4720. Together, these results offer a preclinical proof of
concept for the application of ERBB3-neutralizing antibodies to enhance the
efficacy of RAF inhibitors in melanoma to delay or prevent tumor regrowth. As
ERBB3 is often upregulated in response to other kinase-targeted therapeutics,
these findings may have implications for other cancers as well.

Ovarian cancer has a clear predilection for metastasis to the omentum, but the
underlying mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer spread are not well understood. 
Here, we used a parabiosis model that demonstrates preferential hematogenous
metastasis of ovarian cancer to the omentum. Our studies revealed that the
ErbB3-neuregulin 1 (NRG1) axis is a dominant pathway responsible for hematogenous
omental metastasis. Elevated levels of ErbB3 in ovarian cancer cells and NRG1 in 
the omentum allowed for tumor cell localization and growth in the omentum.
Depletion of ErbB3 in ovarian cancer impaired omental metastasis. Our results
highlight hematogenous metastasis as an important mode of ovarian cancer
metastasis. These findings have implications for designing alternative strategies
aimed at preventing and treating ovarian cancer metastasis.

In breast cancer, neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is known as a ligand for the HER3 receptor,
which has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. When activated by NRG1 binding, 
the HER3 receptor forms a heterodimer with other HER family receptors and
mediates downstream signaling pathways, leading to multiple effects including
growth, proliferation, decreased apoptosis, cellular migration and angiogenesis. 
Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subgroup of cancer cells, are considered to have
features of stem cells such as self-renewal ability and pluripotent
differentiation into other types of mature cells. This study showed that NRG1
treatment induced CSC characteristics in breast cancer cell lines. Using breast
cancer cell lines, MCF-7, SKBr-3 and MDA-MB 468, changes related to CSC
characteristics were analyzed. Flow cytometry was used to analyze changes in CSC 
fractions in multiple cell lines after NRG1 treatment. Western blot analysis and 
immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the expression of CSC markers. To
confirm that NRG1 treatment acts through the HER3 receptor, inhibition studies
using small interfering RNA (siRNA) were performed. In MCF-7 and SKBr-3 cells,
increases in the CSC fraction and expression of CSC markers were observed after
NRG1 treatment. However, MDA-MB 468 cells showed high intrinsic expression of CSC
markers and a high cellular fraction of CSCs, and in these cells, NRG1 treatment 
caused no significant change in CSC characteristics. Inhibition of the HER3
receptor blocked the NRG1-induced CSC characteristics, indicating that NRG1
functions through the HER3 receptor. The results imply the presence of a
mechanism by which the HER receptors, activated by NRG1, contribute to the
acquisition of CSC-like characteristics in some types of breast cancer.

ESCRT components function to form multivesicular bodies for sorting of proteins
destined to the yeast vacuole. The calcium hypersensitivity of ESCRT mutants is
mainly due to repressed expression of PMR1 through the Rim101/Nrg1 pathway in
budding yeast. Here, we show that overexpression of PMC1 and its negative
regulator gene NYV1 suppresses and increases calcium hypersensitivity of ESCRT
mutants, respectively. Consistently, deletion of NYV1 suppresses their calcium
hypersensitivity. Expression of NYV1 is dramatically reduced in ESCRT mutants.
Promoter analysis demonstrates that both Nrg1 and Mig1 repress NYV1 expression.
Deletion of ESCRTs increases Nrg1 binding, but not Mig1-binding, to the NYV1
promoter. Deletion of MIG1 increases calcium sensitivity of ESCRT mutants due to 
derepression of NYV1 expression.

Melanoma is curable when it is at an early phase but is lethal once it becomes
metastatic. The recent development of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors (BIs) showed great
promise in treating metastatic melanoma, but resistance developed quickly in the 
treated patients, and these inhibitors are not effective on melanomas that
express wild-type BRAF. Alternative therapeutic strategies for metastatic
melanoma are urgently needed. Here we report that ERBB3, a member of the
epidermal growth factor receptor family, is required for the formation of lung
metastasis from both the BI-sensitive melanoma cell line, MA-2, and the
BI-resistant melanoma cell line, 451Lu-R. Further analyses revealed that ERBB3
does not affect the initial seeding of melanoma cells in lung but is required for
their further development into overt metastases, indicating that ERBB3 might be
essential for the survival of melanoma cells after they reach the lung.
Consistent with this, the ERBB3 ligand, NRG1, is highly expressed in mouse lungs 
and induces ERBB3-depdnent phosphorylation of AKT in both MA-2 and 451Lu-R cells 
in vitro. These findings suggest that ERBB3 may serve as a target for treating
metastatic melanomas that are resistant to BIs. In support of this,
administration of the pan-ERBB inhibitor, canertinib, significantly suppresses
the metastasis formation of BI-resistant melanoma cell lines.

BACKGROUND: Neuregulins are a family of signalling proteins that orchestrate a
broad range of cellular responses. Four genes encoding Neuregulins 1-4 have been 
identified so far in vertebrates. Among them, Neuregulin 1 and Neuregulin 3 have 
been reported to contribute to an increased risk for developing schizophrenia. We
hypothesized that three specific variants of these genes (rs6994992 and rs3924999
for Neuregulin 1 and rs10748842 for Neuregulin 3) that have been related to this 
illness may modify information processing capacity in the cortex, which would be 
reflected in electrophysiological parameters (P3b amplitude or gamma noise power)
and/or cognitive performance.
METHODS: We obtained DNA from 31 patients with schizophrenia and 23 healthy
controls and analyzed NRG1 rs6994992, NRG1 rs3924999 and NRG3 rs10748842 promoter
polymorphisms by allelic discrimination with real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR). We compared cognitive outcome, P300 amplitude parameters and an
electroencephalographic measure of noise power in the gamma band between the
groups dichotomized according to genotype.
RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, we could not detect any significant
influence of variation in Neuregulin 1/Neuregulin 3 polymorphisms on cognitive
performance or electrophysiological parameters of patients with schizophrenia.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite our findings, we cannot discard that other genetic variants 
and, more likely, interactions between those variants and with genetic variation 
related to different pathways may still influence cerebral processing in
schizophrenia.

Risk of schizophrenia is likely to involve gene × environment (G × E)
interactions. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a schizophrenia risk gene, hence any
interaction with environmental adversity, such as maternal infection, may provide
further insights into the basis of the disease. This study examined the
individual and combined effects of prenatal immune activation with
polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (Poly I:C) and disruption of the
schizophrenia risk gene NRG1 on the expression of behavioral phenotypes related
to schizophrenia. NRG1 heterozygous (NRG1 HET) mutant breeding pairs were
time-mated. Pregnant dams received a single injection (5mg/kg i.p.) of Poly I:C
or vehicle on gestation day 9 (GD9). Offspring were then cross-fostered to
vehicle-treated or Poly I:C-treated dams. Expression of schizophrenia-related
behavioral endophenotypes was assessed at adolescence and in adulthood. Combining
NRG1 disruption and prenatal environmental insult (Poly I:C) caused developmental
stage-specific deficits in social behavior, spatial working memory and prepulse
inhibition (PPI). However, combining Poly I:C and cross-fostering produced a
number of behavioral deficits in the open field, social behavior and PPI. This
became more complex by combining NRG1 deletion with both Poly I:C exposure and
cross-fostering, which had a robust effect on PPI. These findings suggest that
concepts of G × E interaction in risk of schizophrenia should be elaborated to
multiple interactions that involve individual genes interacting with diverse
biological and psychosocial environmental factors over early life, to

Mutant mice play an increasingly important role in understanding disease
processes at multiple levels. In particular, they illuminate the impact of risk
genes for disease on such processes. This article reviews recent advances in the 
application of mutant mice to study the intricacies of dopaminergic (DAergic)
function in relation to the putative pathophysiology of psychotic illness,
particularly schizophrenia, and antipsychotic drug action. It considers models
for understanding the role(s) of risk genes, with a particular focus on DTNBP1
and NRG1, their interactions with environmental factors, and with each other
(epistasis). In overview, it considers new schemas for understanding psychotic
illness that integrate DAergic pathophysiology with developmental, social, and
cognitive processes, and how mutant mouse models can reflect and inform on such
schemas.

Schwann cells (SCs) in the peripheral nerves myelinate axons during postnatal
development to allow saltatory conduction of nerve impulses. Well-organized
structures of myelin sheathes are maintained throughout life unless nerves are
insulted. After peripheral nerve injury, unidentified signals from injured nerves
drive SC dedifferentiation into an immature state. Dedifferentiated SCs
participate in axonal regeneration by producing neurotrophic factors and removing
degenerating nerve debris. In this review, we focus on the role of mitogen
activated protein kinase family proteins (MAP kinases) in SC dedifferentiation.
In addition, we will highlight neuregulin 1 and the transcription factor c-jun as
upstream and downstream signals for MAP kinases in SC responses to nerve injury.

PURPOSE: TAZ, also known as WWTR1, has recently been suggested as an oncogene in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the clinical relevance of TAZ
expression and its functional role in NSCLC tumorigenesis.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We characterized TAZ at the DNA (n=192), mRNA (n=196), and
protein levels (n=345) in an NSCLC patient cohort. Gene expression analysis was
complemented by a meta-analysis of public datasets (n=1,382). The effects of TAZ 
on cell proliferation and cell cycle were analyzed in cell cultures and on tumor 
growth in mice. TAZ-dependent microarray-based expression profiles in NSCLC cells
were combined with molecular profiles in human NSCLC tissues for in silico
analysis.
RESULTS: Higher TAZ mRNA and protein levels were associated with shorter patient 
survival. Transduction of TAZ enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in
bronchial epithelial cells, whereas TAZ silencing suppressed cell proliferation
and induced cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells. Microarray and cell culture
experiments showed that ErbB ligands (amphiregulin, epiregulin, and neuregulin 1)
are downstream targets of TAZ. Our in silico analysis revealed a TAZ signature
that substantiated the clinical impact of TAZ and confirmed its relationship to
the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: TAZ expression defines a clinically distinct subgroup of patients
with NSCLC. ErbB ligands are suggested to mediate the effects of TAZ on lung
cancer progression. Our findings emphasize the tumorigenic role of TAZ and may
serve as the basis for new treatment strategies.

Neuropathologic implication of peripheral neuregulin-1 and EGF signals in
dopaminergic dysfunction and behavioral deficits relevant to schizophrenia: their
target cells and time window.

Neuregulin-1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are implicated in the pathogenesis
of schizophrenia. To test the developmental hypothesis for schizophrenia, we
administered these factors to rodent pups, juveniles, and adults and
characterized neurobiological and behavioral consequences. These factors were
also provided from their transgenes or infused into the adult brain. Here we
summarize previous results from these experiments and discuss those from
neuropathological aspects. In the neonatal stage but not the juvenile and adult
stages, subcutaneously injected factors penetrated the blood-brain barrier and
acted on brain neurons, which later resulted in persistent behavioral and
dopaminergic impairments associated with schizophrenia. Neonatally EGF-treated
animals exhibited persistent hyperdopaminergic abnormalities in the
nigro-pallido-striatal system while neuregulin-1 treatment resulted in
dopaminergic deficits in the corticolimbic dopamine system. Effects on GABAergic 
and glutamatergic systems were transient or limited. Even in the adult stage,
intracerebral administration and transgenic expression of these factors produced 
similar but not identical behavioral impairments, although the effects of
intracerebral administration were reversible. These findings suggest that
dopaminergic development is highly vulnerable to circulating ErbB ligands in the 
pre- and perinatal stages. Once maldevelopment of the dopaminergic system is
established during early development, dopamine-associating behavioral deficits
become irreversible and manifest at postpubertal stages.

Effects of schizophrenia risk variation in the NRG1 gene on NRG1-IV splicing
during fetal and early postnatal human neocortical development.

Paterson C, Wang Y, Kleinman JE, Law AJ.

Comment in
    Am J Psychiatry. 2014 Sep;171(9):906-9.

OBJECTIVE: Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a multifunctional neurotrophin that mediates
neurodevelopment and schizophrenia risk. The NRG1 gene undergoes extensive
alternative splicing, and association of brain NRG1 type IV isoform expression
with the schizophrenia-risk polymorphism rs6994992 is a potential mechanism of
risk. Novel splice variants of NRG1-IV (NRG1-IVNV), with predicted unique
signaling capabilities, have been cloned in fetal brain tissue. The authors
investigated the temporal dynamics of transcription of NRG1-IVNV, compared with
the major NRG1 isoforms, across human prenatal and postnatal prefrontal cortical 
development, and they examined the association of rs6994992 with NRG1-IVNV
expression.
METHOD: NRG1 type I-IV and NRG1-IVNV isoforms were evaluated with quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction in human postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue 
samples at 14 to 39 weeks gestation and postnatal ages 0-83 years. The
association of rs6994992 genotype with NRG1-IVNV expression and the subcellular
distribution and proteolytic processing of NRG1-IVNV isoforms were also
determined.
RESULTS: Expression of NRG1 types I, II, and III was temporally regulated during 
prenatal and postnatal neocortical development. NRG1-IVNV was expressed from 16
weeks gestation until age 3. Homozygosity for the schizophrenia risk allele (T)
of rs6994992 conferred lower cortical NRG1-IVNV levels. Assays showed that
NRG1-IVNV is a novel nuclear-enriched, truncated NRG1 protein resistant to
proteolytic processing.
CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this study provides the first
quantitative map of NRG1 isoform expression during human neocortical development 
and aging. It identifies a potential mechanism of early developmental risk for
schizophrenia at the NRG1 locus, involving a novel class of NRG1 proteins.

Do individually ventilated cage systems generate a problem for genetic mouse
model research?

Logge W(1), Kingham J, Karl T.

Author information: 
(1)Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), Randwick; Schizophrenia Research
Institute, Darlinghurst.

Technological developments over recent decades have produced a novel housing
system for laboratory mice, so-called 'individually ventilated cage' (IVC)
systems. IVCs present a cage environment which is different to conventional
filter-top cages (FILTER). Nothing is known about the consequences of IVC housing
on genetic mouse models, despite studies reporting IVC-mediated changes to the
phenotypes of inbred mouse strains. Thus, in this study, we systematically
compared the established behavioural phenotype of a validated mouse model for the
schizophrenia risk gene neuregulin 1 (TM Nrg1 HET) kept in FILTER housing with
Nrg1 mutant mice raised in IVC systems. We found that particular
schizophrenia-relevant endophenotypes of TM Nrg1 HETs which had been established 
and widely published using FILTER housing were altered when mice were raised in
IVC housing. IVCs diminished the schizophrenia-relevant prepulse inhibition
deficit of Nrg1 mutant males. Furthermore, IVC housing had a sex-dependent
moderate effect on the locomotive phenotype of Nrg1 mice across test paradigms.
Behavioural effects of IVC housing were less prominent in female mice. Thus,
transferring the breeding colony of mouse mutants from FILTER to IVC systems can 
shift disease-relevant behaviours and therefore challenge the face validity of
these mice. Researchers facing an upgrade of their mouse breeding or holding
facilities to IVC systems must be aware of the potential impact this upgrade
might have on their genetic mouse models. Future publications should provide more
details on the cage system used to allow appropriate data comparison across
research sites.

City, 220, Taiwan.

Several new chromosomal translocations resulting in driver fusion mutations have 
recently been discovered in non-small-cell lung cancer. The driver mutational
patterns in pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma, a rare subtype of non-small-cell
lung cancer, have not been well studied. A single-institute cohort study in
Taiwan was performed to determine the mutations of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), fusions of
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), and neuregulin 1
(NRG1) in patients diagnosed with pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma. We also
examined NRG1 translocation in patients diagnosed as adenocarcinoma of other
subtypes with wild-type EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and ROS1 genes. Surgical or biopsy
specimens were collected from 13 patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma. Using the
direct RNA sequencing method, we discovered a rare CD74-NRG1 fusion (8 %), an
echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion (17 %), and
three KRAS mutations (25 %). No EGFR mutations or ROS1 rearrangements were
detected. The rare CD74-NRG1 fusion positive patient presented with uncommon
radiological features. We did not detect any CD74-NRG1 fusion in the 109
adenocarcinoma of other subtypes, which were all negative for EGFR, KRAS, ALK,
and ROS1. The CD74-NRG1 fusion mutation is rare and may be exclusively present in
patients with pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma. Patients harboring CD74-NRG1
positive tumors may present with uncommon imaging features.

Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and the γ-secretase subunit APH1B have been previously
implicated as genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and schizophrenia relevant
deficits have been observed in rodent models with loss of function mutations in
either gene. Here we show that the Aph1b-γ-secretase is selectively involved in
Nrg1 intracellular signalling. We found that Aph1b-deficient mice display a
decrease in excitatory synaptic markers. Electrophysiological recordings show
that Aph1b is required for excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity.
Furthermore, gain and loss of function and genetic rescue experiments indicate
that Nrg1 intracellular signalling promotes dendritic spine formation downstream 
of Aph1b-γ-secretase in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study sheds light
on the physiological role of Aph1b-γ-secretase in brain and provides a new
mechanistic perspective on the relevance of NRG1 processing in schizophrenia.

Grb2-associated binders (Gabs) are scaffolding proteins implicated in cell
signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases including neuregulin-1(NRG1)-ErbB
receptor signaling, which is essential for peripheral nerve myelination. Here, we
show that the conditional removal of Gab1 from Schwann cells resulted in
hypomyelination and abnormal development of Remak bundles. In contrast,
hypomyelination was not observed in conventional Gab2 knock-out mice. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of Gab1, but not Gab2, in sciatic nerves was upregulated during
the myelination period and was found to be suppressed in NRG1-type III(+/-) mice,
which display a hypomyelinated phenotype similar to that observed in Gab1
knock-out mice. Gab1 knock-out and NRG1-type III(+/-) mice both exhibited reduced
extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity in myelinating nerves. In
addition, Krox20, a transcription factor that is critical for myelination, has
been identified as a target of the NRG1-Gab1 pathway during the myelination
process. Our findings suggest that Gab1 is an essential component of NRG1-type
III signaling during peripheral nerve development.

Diseases, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a stress-mediated growth factor secreted by
cardiovascular endothelial cells and provides the protection to myocardial cells,
but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to
demonstrate that NRG-1 protects myocardial cells exposed to oxidative damage by
regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes
(NRCMs) were isolated and treated with H2 O2 as a cellular model of ER stress.
NRCMs were pretreated with different concentrations of NRG-1. We found that NRG-1
increased the viability and reduced the apoptosis of NRCMs treated by H2 O2 .
Moreover, NRG-1 reduced lactate dehydrogenase level, increased superoxide
dismutase activity and decreased malondialdehyde content in NRCMs treated by H2
O2 . Finally, we demonstrated that NRG-1 alleviated ER stress and decreased CHOP 
and GRP78 protein levels in NRCMs treated by H2 O2 . Taken together, these data
indicate that NRG-1 relieves oxidative and ER stress in NRCMs and suggest that
NRG-1 is a promising agent for cardioprotection.

The neuregulin-1 (NRG1) gene is one of the best-validated risk genes for
schizophrenia, and psychotic and bipolar disorders. The rs6994992 variant in the 
NRG1 promoter (SNP8NRG243177) is associated with altered frontal and temporal
brain macrostructures and/or altered white matter density and integrity in
schizophrenic adults, as well as healthy adults and neonates. However, the ages
when these changes begin and whether neuroimaging phenotypes are associated with 
cognitive performance are not fully understood. Therefore, we investigated the
association of the rs6994992 variant on developmental trajectories of brain
macro- and microstructures, and their relationship with cognitive performance. A 
total of 972 healthy children aged 3-20 years had the genotype available for the 
NRG1-rs6994992 variant, and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
and neuropsychological tests. Age-by-NRG1-rs6994992 interactions and genotype
effects were assessed using a general additive model regression methodology,
covaried for scanner type, socioeconomic status, sex and genetic ancestry
factors. Compared with the C-carriers, children with the TT-risk-alleles had
subtle microscopic and macroscopic changes in brain development that emerge or
reverse during adolescence, a period when many psychiatric disorders are
manifested. TT-children at late adolescence showed a lower age-dependent
forniceal volume and lower fractional anisotropy; however, both measures were
associated with better episodic memory performance. To our knowledge, we provide 
the first multimodal imaging evidence that genetic variation in NRG1 is
associated with age-related changes on brain development during typical childhood
and adolescence, and delineated the altered patterns of development in multiple
brain regions in children with the T-risk allele(s).

Neuregulin1-β decreases IL-1β-induced neutrophil adhesion to human brain
microvascular endothelial cells.

Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA.

Neuroinflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of diverse diseases
including stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
disease, and multiple sclerosis, resulting in neurodegeneration and loss of
neurological function. The response of the microvascular endothelium often
contributes to neuroinflammation. One such response is the upregulation of
endothelial adhesion molecules which facilitate neutrophil adhesion to the
endothelium and their migration from blood to tissue. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is an
endogenous growth factor which has been reported to have anti-inflammatory
effects in experimental stroke models. We hypothesized that NRG1 would decrease
the endothelial response to inflammation and result in a decrease in neutrophil
adhesion to endothelial cells. We tested this hypothesis in an in vitro model of 
cytokine-induced endothelial injury, in which human brain microvascular
endothelial cells (BMECs) were treated with IL-1β, along with co-incubation with 
vehicle or NRG1-β. Outcome measures included protein levels of endothelial
ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, as well as the number of neutrophils that adhere 
to the endothelial monolayer. Our data show that NRG1-β decreased the levels of
VCAM-1, E-selectin, and neutrophil adhesion to brain microvascular endothelial
cells activated by IL1-β. These findings open new possibilities for investigating
NRG1 in neuroprotective strategies in brain injury.

limited due to acquired resistance and activation of alternative RTKs. Therefore,
we asked if cancer cells are able to overcome targeted Axl therapies. Here, we
demonstrate that inhibition of Axl by short interfering RNA or the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) BMS777607 induces the expression of human epidermal growth
factor receptor 3 (HER3) and the neuregulin 1(NRG1)-dependent phosphorylation of 
HER3 in MDA-MB231 and Ovcar8 cells. Moreover, analysis of 20 Axl-expressing
cancer cell lines of different tissue origin indicates a low basal
phosphorylation of RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) as a general
requirement for HER3 activation on Axl inhibition. Consequently, phosphorylation 
of AKT arises as an independent biomarker for Axl treatment. Additionally, we
introduce phosphorylation of HER3 as an independent pharmacodynamic biomarker for
monitoring of anti-Axl therapy response. Inhibition of cell viability by
BMS777607 could be rescued by NRG1-dependent activation of HER3, suggesting an
escape mechanism by tumor microenvironment. The Axl-TKI MPCD84111 simultaneously 
blocked Axl and HER2/3 signaling and thereby prohibited HER3 feedback activation.
Furthermore, dual inhibition of Axl and HER2/3 using BMS777607 and lapatinib led 
to a significant inhibition of cell viability in Axl-expressing MDA-MB231 and
Ovcar8 cells. Therefore, we conclude that, in patient cohorts with expression of 
Axl and low basal activity of AKT, a combined inhibition of Axl and HER2/3 kinase
would be beneficial to overcome acquired resistance to Axl-targeted therapies.

Loss-of-function mutations in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and
tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (SH3TC2) gene cause autosomal recessive demyelinating
Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. The SH3TC2 protein has been implicated in
promyelination signaling through axonal neuregulin-1 and the ERBB2 Schwann cell
receptor. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the
SH3TC2 gene. We performed computational and functional analyses that revealed two
cis-acting regulatory elements at SH3TC2-one at the promoter and one ∼150 kb
downstream of the transcription start site. Both elements direct reporter gene
expression in Schwann cells and are responsive to the transcription factor SOX10,
which is essential for peripheral nervous system myelination. The downstream
enhancer harbors a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that causes an ∼80%
reduction in enhancer activity. The SNP resides directly within a predicted
binding site for the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein
(CREB), and we demonstrate that this regulatory element binds to CREB and is
activated by CREB expression. Finally, forskolin induces Sh3tc2 expression in rat
primary Schwann cells, indicating that SH3TC2 is a CREB target gene. These
findings prompted us to determine if SNP genotypes at SH3TC2 are associated with 
differential phenotypes in the most common demyelinating peripheral neuropathy,
CMT1A. Interestingly, this revealed several associations between SNP alleles and 
disease severity. In summary, our data indicate that SH3TC2 is regulated by the
transcription factors CREB and SOX10, define a regulatory SNP at this
disease-associated locus and reveal SH3TC2 as a candidate modifier locus of CMT
disease phenotypes.

Current therapies for cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) are still limited. Until
recently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the spinal cell-mediated CIBP
remain largely unknown. To better understand the role of spinal cells in CIBP, we
investigated the role of spinal neuregulin1 (NRG1)‑ErbB2 signaling pathway in
CIBP. In this study, a rat model of CIBP was established by intra-tibia
inoculation of Walker 256 mammary gland carcinoma cells. Tibia bone destruction
was evaluated using various methods of Walker 256 inoculation, radiobioassay and 
histological analysis. Pain-like behavior including thermal hyperalgesia and
mechanical allodynia were determined by measuring paw withdrawal latency (PWL)
and mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT). The expression level of mRNA or
protein of target genes was examined by quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis,
respectively. Bone destruction, as well as thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical
allodynia, were observed at the 6th day following Walker 256 inoculation. A
time-dependent increase in the levels of NRG1, ErbB2 and p-ErbB2 could be
detected within three weeks after tumor cell injection. ErbB2 signaling
inactivation by PD168393 treatment significantly attenuated pain-like behavior,
associated with inhibition of Akt-1 and p38MAPK activation. Administration of
exogenous NRG1 provoked pain-like behavior in rats by induction of activation of 
ErbB2, Akt-1 and p38MAPK, which could be blocked by ErbB2 inhibitor. Our results 
indicate that activation of NRG1‑ErbB2 signaling pathway plays a critical role in
the induction of CIBP. Akt-1 and p38MAPK may be potent players involved in the
NRG1-ErbB2 pathway in CIBP.

C boutons are large, cholinergic, synaptic terminals that arise from local
interneurons and specifically contact spinal α-motoneurons (MNs). C boutons
characteristically display a postsynaptic specialization consisting of an
endoplasmic reticulum-related subsurface cistern (SSC) of unknown function. In
the present work, by using confocal microscopy and ultrastructural
immunolabeling, we demonstrate that neuregulin-1 (NRG1) accumulates in the SSC of
mouse spinal MNs. We also show that the NRG1 receptors erbB2 and erbB4 are
presynaptically localized within C boutons, suggesting that NRG1-based retrograde
signaling may occur in this type of synapse. In most of the cranial nuclei, MNs
display the same pattern of NRG1 distribution as that observed in spinal cord
MNs. Conversely, MNs in oculomotor nuclei, which are spared in amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), lack both C boutons and SSC-associated NRG1. NRG1 in
spinal MNs is developmentally regulated and depends on the maintenance of
nerve-muscle interactions, as we show after nerve transection experiments.
Changes in NRG1 in C boutons were also investigated in mouse models of MN
diseases: i.e., spinal muscular atrophy (SMNΔ7) and ALS (SOD1(G93A)). In both
models, a transient increase in NRG1 in C boutons occurs during disease
progression. These data increase our understanding of the role of C boutons in MN
physiology and pathology.

Candida albicans is known as a commensal microorganism but it is also the most
common fungal pathogen in humans, causing both mucosal and systemic infections.
Biofilm-associated C. albicans infections present clinically important features
due to their high levels of resistance to traditional antifungal agents. Quorum
sensing is closely associated with biofilm formation and increasing fungal
pathogenicity. We investigated the ability of the novel bacterial quorum sensing 
quencher thiazolidinedione-8 (S-8) to inhibit the formation of, and eradication
of mature C. albicans biofilms. In addition, the capability of S-8 to alter
fungal adhesion to mammalian cells was checked. S-8 exhibited specific
antibiofilm and antiadhesion activities against C. albicans, at four- to
eightfold lower concentrations than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that S-8 dose-dependently reduces C.
albicans-GFP binding to RAW macrophages. S-8 at sub-MICs also interfered with
fungal morphogenesis by inhibiting the yeast-to-hyphal form transition. In
addition, the tested agent strongly affected fungal cell wall characteristics by 
modulating its hydrophobicity. We evaluated the molecular mode of S-8 antibiofilm
and antiadhesion activities using real-time RT-PCR. The expression levels of
genes associated with biofilm formation, adhesion and filamentation, HWP1, ALS3
and EAP1, respectively, were dose-dependently downregulated by S-8. Transcript
levels of UME6, responsible for long-term hyphal maintenance, were also
significantly decreased by the tested agent. Both signaling pathways of hyphal
formation-cAMP-PKA and MAPK-were interrupted by S-8. Their upstream general
regulator RAS1 was markedly suppressed by S-8. In addition, the expression levels
of MAPK cascade components CST20, HST7 and CPH1 were downregulated by S-8.
Finally, transcriptional repressors of filament formation, TUP1 and NRG1, were
dramatically upregulated by our compound. Our results indicate that S-8 holds a
novel antibiofilm therapeutic mean in the treatment and prevention of
biofilm-associated C. albicans infections.

Multi-modal data analysis techniques, such as the Parallel Independent Component 
Analysis (pICA), are essential in neuroscience, medical imaging and genetic
studies. The pICA algorithm allows the simultaneous decomposition of up to two
data modalities achieving better performance than separate ICA decompositions and
enabling the discovery of links between modalities. However, advances in data
acquisition techniques facilitate the collection of more than two data modalities
from each subject. Examples of commonly measured modalities include genetic
information, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI. In
order to take full advantage of the available data, this work extends the pICA
approach to incorporate three modalities in one comprehensive analysis.
Simulations demonstrate the three-way pICA performance in identifying pairwise
links between modalities and estimating independent components which more closely
resemble the true sources than components found by pICA or separate ICA analyses.
In addition, the three-way pICA algorithm is applied to real experimental data
obtained from a study that investigate genetic effects on alcohol dependence.
Considered data modalities include functional MRI (contrast images during alcohol
exposure paradigm), gray matter concentration images from structural MRI and
genetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The three-way pICA approach
identified links between a SNP component (pointing to brain function and mental
disorder associated genes, including BDNF, GRIN2B and NRG1), a functional
component related to increased activation in the precuneus area, and a gray
matter component comprising part of the default mode network and the caudate.
Although such findings need further verification, the simulation and in-vivo
results validate the three-way pICA algorithm presented here as a useful tool in 
biomedical data fusion applications.

Accumulating evidence suggests that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) might be involved in the 
neurodevelopment, neural plasticity, GABAergic neurotransmission, and
pathogenesis of schizophrenia. NRG1 is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus,
and emerging studies have begun to reveal the link between NRG1 signaling and
cognitive deficits in schizophrenic patients. Because the transmembrane domain of
NRG1 is vital for both forward and reverse signaling cascades, new Nrg1-deficient
mice that carry a truncation of the transmembrane domain of the Nrg1 gene were
characterized and used in this study to test a NRG1 loss-of-function hypothesis
for schizophrenia. Both male and female Nrg1 heterozygous mutant mice and their
wild-type littermates were used in a series of 4 experiments to characterize the 
impact of Nrg1 on behavioral phenotypes and to determine the importance of Nrg1
in the regulation of hippocampal neuromorphology and local GABAergic
interneurons. First, a comprehensive battery of behavioral tasks indicated that
male Nrg1-deficient mice exhibited significant impairments in cognitive
functions. Second, pharmacological challenges were conducted and revealed that
Nrg1 haploinsufficiency altered GABAergic activity in males. Third, although no
genotype-specific neuromorphological alterations were found in the hippocampal
CA1 pyramidal neurons, significant reductions in the hippocampal expressions of
GAD67 and parvalbumin were revealed in the Nrg1-deficient males. Fourth, chronic 
treatment with valproate rescued the observed behavioral deficits and hippocampal
GAD67 reduction in Nrg1-deficient males. Collectively, these results indicate the
potential therapeutic effect of valproate and the importance of Nrg1 in the
regulation of cognitive functions and hippocampal GABAergic interneurons,
especially in males.

BACKGROUND: Based on the function of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) in neurodevelopment,
susceptibility to bipolar disorder presumably involves this gene. The 3' region
of NRG1 contains the majority of the coding exons, and transcripts from this
region encode 8 of the 9 known NRG1 isoforms; therefore, this region is likely to
be predominant versus the 5' region in terms of their relative contributions to
NRG1 function. We investigated the association between the 3' region of the NRG1 
gene and bipolar I disorder (BPI) in the Chinese Han population and performed
further analyses depending on the presence or absence of psychotic features.
METHODS: A total of 385 BPI patients and 475 healthy controls were recruited for 
this study. Thirty tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the 3'
region of the NRG1 gene were genotyped for allelic and haplotypic associations
with BPI and subgroups with psychotic features (BPI-P) or without psychotic
features (BPI-NP).
RESULTS: Individual marker analysis showed that 2 SNPs (rs12547858 and rs6468121)
in this region were significantly associated with BPI. Moreover, subgroup
analyses showed significant but marginal associations of rs6468121 with BPI-P and
rs3757933 with BPI-NP. Haplotype analyses showed that 6 haplotypes were
associated with BPI only.
LIMITATIONS: The sample size was relatively small. The investigated tag SNPs only
represented 83% of the information on the targeted region. There might be a
retrospective bias in the subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the 3' region of the NRG1 gene plays a role 
in BPI susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. In addition, the preliminary
results show that BPI with psychotic features and BPI without psychotic features 
may constitute different sub-phenotypes; however, this finding should be
confirmed in a larger population sample.

Recent insights in the paracrine modulation of cardiomyocyte contractility by
cardiac endothelial cells.

The cardiac endothelium is formed by a continuous monolayer of cells that line
the cavity of the heart (endocardial endothelial cells (EECs)) and the luminal
surface of the myocardial blood vessels (intramyocardial capillary endothelial
cells (IMCEs)). EECs and IMCEs can exercise substantial control over the
contractility of cardiomyocytes by releasing various factors such as nitric oxide
(NO) via a constitutive endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS), endothelin-1,
prostaglandins, angiotensin II, peptide growth factors, and neuregulin-1. The
purpose of the present paper is actually to shortly review recent new information
concerning cardiomyocytes as effectors of endothelium paracrine signaling,
focusing particularly on contractile function. The modes of action and the
regulatory paracrine role of the main mediators delivered by cardiac endothelial 
cells upon cardiac contractility identified in cardiomyocytes are complex and not
fully described. Thus, careful evaluation of new therapeutic approaches is
required targeting important physiological signaling pathways, some of which have
been until recently considered as deleterious, like reactive oxygen species.
Future works in the field of cardiac endothelial cells and cardiac function will 
help to better understand the implication of these mediators in cardiac
physiopathology.

PURPOSE: To identify druggable oncogenic fusions in invasive mucinous
adenocarcinoma (IMA) of the lung, a malignant type of lung adenocarcinoma in
which KRAS mutations frequently occur.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: From an IMA cohort of 90 cases, consisting of 56 cases (62%)
with KRAS mutations and 34 cases without (38%), we conducted whole-transcriptome 
sequencing of 32 IMAs, including 27 cases without KRAS mutations. We used the
sequencing data to identify gene fusions, and then performed functional analyses 
of the fusion gene products.
RESULTS: We identified oncogenic fusions that occurred mutually exclusively with 
KRAS mutations: CD74-NRG1, SLC3A2-NRG1, EZR-ERBB4, TRIM24-BRAF, and KIAA1468-RET.
NRG1 fusions were present in 17.6% (6/34) of KRAS-negative IMAs. The CD74-NRG1
fusion activated HER2:HER3 signaling, whereas the EZR-ERBB4 and TRIM24-BRAF
fusions constitutively activated the ERBB4 and BRAF kinases, respectively.
Signaling pathway activation and fusion-induced anchorage-independent
growth/tumorigenicity of NIH3T3 cells expressing these fusions were suppressed by
tyrosine kinase inhibitors approved for clinical use.
CONCLUSIONS: Oncogenic fusions act as driver mutations in IMAs without KRAS
mutations, and thus represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of 
such IMAs.

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib is currently used for treating patients with BRAF 
V600E mutant melanoma. However, the responses to vemurafenib are generally
partial and of relatively short duration. Recent evidence suggests that
activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/erbB signaling pathway 
may be responsible for the development of BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma
patients. In this study, we characterized the erbB family of receptors and
ligands in melanoma cell lines and examined whether targeting both BRAF and erbB 
provided enhanced antitumor activity in BRAF mutant melanoma. Variable levels of 
erbB2, erbB3, and truncated erbB4 were expressed in both BRAF wildtype and mutant
melanoma cells with no significant differences between wildtype and mutant lines.
EGFR was rarely expressed. Neuregulin 3 and neuregulin 4 were the major erbB
ligands released by melanoma cells. Multi-erbB targeting with the irreversible
tyrosine kinase inhibitor canertinib exerted a more effective growth inhibitory
effect in both BRAF wildtype and mutant melanoma cells compared with the
single-erbB or dual-erbB targeting inhibitors, gefitinib, erlotinib, and
lapatinib. Canertinib inhibited both EGF-induced and neuregulin 1-induced erbB
downstream signaling in both mutant and wildtype cell lines. However, canertinib 
induced apoptosis and sub-G1 arrest only in mutant cells. Canertinib
statistically increased the antiproliferative effects of vemurafenib in the BRAF 
mutant melanoma cell lines while little or no enhanced effect was observed with
the combination treatment in the wildtype cell lines. A combined inhibition
strategy targeting BRAF together with multiple erbB family kinases is potentially
beneficial for treating BRAF V600E mutant melanoma. Wildtype BRAF melanoma may
also benefit from a multi-erbB kinase inhibitor.

BACKGROUND: Changes in fiber tract architecture have gained attention as a
potentially important aspect of schizophrenia neuropathology. Although the exact 
pathogenesis of these abnormalities yet remains to be elucidated, a genetic
component is highly likely. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is one of the best-validated
schizophrenia susceptibility genes. We here report the impact of the Neuregulin-1
rs35753505 variant on white matter structure in healthy young individuals with no
family history of psychosis.
METHODS: We compared fractional anisotropy in 54 subjects that were either
homozygous for the risk C allele carriers (n = 31) for rs35753505 or homozygous
for the T allele (n = 23) using diffusion tensor imaging with 3T. Tract-Based
Spatial Statistics (TBSS), a method especially developed for diffusion data
analysis, was used to improve white matter registration and to focus the
statistical analysis to major fiber tracts.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that homozygous risk C allele carriers
featured elevated fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right perihippocampal region 
and the white matter proximate to the left area 4p as well as the right
hemisphere of the cerebellum. We found three clusters of reduced FA values in
homozygous C allele carriers: in the left superior parietal region, the right
prefrontal white matter and in the deep white matter of the left frontal lobe.
CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the importance of Neuregulin-1 for structural
connectivity of the right medial temporal lobe. This finding is in line with well
known neuropathological findings in this region in patients with schizophrenia.

The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 13.7 million Americans
with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2012. With the rising number of
cancer survivors, there is an increased focus on how chemotherapy agents modulate
the cardiovascular biology and cause chemotherapy-related heart failure in
certain patients. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is an important cardiac growth factor that
is essential for normal myocardial development and maintenance. Certain
chemotherapy agents perturb the normal NRG-1 signaling in the cardiovascular
system and cause cardiac dysfunction and, in some cases, symptomatic heart
failure. As researchers have learned the critical importance of NRG-1 within the 
cardiovascular system, more attention has been focused on the potential use of
NRG-1 as biomarker and therapy for the treatment of heart failure. This review
will highlight the biology of NRG-1 within the cardiovascular system, its role in
chemotherapy-induced heart failure, and the translational potential of NRG-1 as
treatment for heart failure.

HER3/ErbB3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, has a
pivotal role in cancer and is emerging as a therapeutic antibody target. In this 
study, we identified NEDD4 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally
downregulated 4) as a novel interaction partner and ubiquitin E3 ligase of human 
HER3. Using molecular and biochemical approaches, we demonstrated that the
C-terminal tail of HER3 interacted with the WW domains of NEDD4 and the
interaction was independent of neuregulin-1. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of NEDD4
elevated HER3 levels and resulted in increased HER3 signaling and cancer cell
proliferation in vitro and in vivo. A similar inverse relationship between HER3
and NEDD4 levels was observed in prostate cancer tumor tissues. More importantly,
the upregulated HER3 expression by NEDD4 knockdown sensitized cancer cells for
growth inhibition by an anti-HER3 antibody. Taken together, our results suggest
that low NEDD4 levels may predict activation of HER3 signaling and efficacies of 
anti-HER3 antibody therapies.

oocyte maturation.

Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is induced in granulosa cells by LH and acts on granulosa and
cumulus cells during ovulation. In this study, we sought to determine the role of
NRG1 in oocyte maturation by generating a granulosa cell-specific Nrg1 knockout
mouse (Nrg1(flox/flox);Cyp19a1Cre mice [gcNrg1KO]). In the gcNrg1KO mice, meiosis
was induced 2 hours earlier than in control mice. More than 60% of the oocytes in
the mutant mice spontaneously re-resumed meiosis beyond the MII stage. The
percentage of successful fertilization was comparable in oocytes of both
genotypes collected at 14 or 16 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin
injection but was significantly lower in oocytes of the gcNrg1KO mice at 18 or 20
hours. The number of pups per litter was significantly decreased in gcNrg1KO
mice. To determine the molecular events associated with the abnormal progression 
of meiosis in the gcNrg1KO mouse oocytes, the defects of cumulus/granulosa cell
functions were analyzed. The expression of genes involved in luteinization and
cumulus expansion was significantly higher at 2 hours after human chorionic
gonadotropin injection in the gcNrg1KO mice; this was related to abnormal
activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphorylation of connexin-43 in
cumulus cells. Changes in connexin-43 by PKC might lead to early meiotic
resumption of oocytes in gcNrg1KO mice. We conclude that NRG1 is induced by LH in
mural granulosa cells and exerts an important regulatory role in oocyte meiotic
maturation and competence by reducing PKC activation in cumulus cells and
preventing premature progression to the MII stage that leads to abnormal
fertilization and fertility.

The β-site APP cleaving enzymes 1 and 2 (BACE1 and BACE2) were initially
identified as transmembrane aspartyl proteases cleaving the amyloid precursor
protein (APP). BACE1 is a major drug target for Alzheimer's disease because
BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP is the first step in the generation of the
pathogenic amyloid-β peptides. BACE1, which is highly expressed in the nervous
system, is also required for myelination by cleaving neuregulin 1. Several recent
proteomic and in vivo studies using BACE1- and BACE2-deficient mice demonstrate a
much wider range of physiological substrates and functions for both proteases
within and outside of the nervous system. For BACE1 this includes axon guidance, 
neurogenesis, muscle spindle formation, and neuronal network functions, whereas
BACE2 was shown to be involved in pigmentation and pancreatic β-cell function.
This review highlights the recent progress in understanding cell biology,
substrates, and functions of BACE proteases and discusses the therapeutic options
and potential mechanism-based liabilities, in particular for BACE inhibitors in
Alzheimer's disease. The protease BACE1 is a major drug target in Alzheimer
disease. Together with its homolog BACE2, both proteases have an increasing
number of functions within and outside of the nervous system. This review
highlights recent progress in understanding cell biology, substrates, and
functions of BACE proteases and discusses the therapeutic options and potential
mechanism-based liabilities, in particular for BACE inhibitors in Alzheimer
disease.

Neuregulin 1 and its receptor ErbB4 are confirmed risk genes for schizophrenia,
but the neuropathological alterations in NRG1-ErbB4 in schizophrenia are unclear.
The present investigations therefore focused on determining lamina specific
(ErbB4-pan) and quantitative (pan, JMa, JMb, CYT1 and CYT2) ErbB4 mRNA changes in
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in schizophrenia. We also determined
which neuronal profiles are ErbB4 mRNA+ in the human DLPFC and the relationship
between ErbB4 and interneuron marker mRNAs. In situ hybridisation and
quantitative PCR measurements were performed to determine changes in ErbB4 splice
variant mRNA levels in the DLPFC in schizophrenia (n = 37) compared to control
(n = 37) subjects. Cortical neurons expressing ErbB4-pan were labelled with
silver grain clusters. Correlations were performed between ErbB4 and interneuron 
mRNA levels. ErbB4-pan mRNA was significantly increased (layers I, II and V) in
the DLPFC in schizophrenia. Silver grain clusters for ErbB4-pan were detected
predominantly over small-medium neurons with low-no expression in the larger,
paler, more triangular neuronal profiles. ErbB4-JMa mRNA expression was increased
in schizophrenia. Somatostatin, neuropeptide Y and vasoactive intestinal peptide 
mRNAs negatively correlated with ErbB4-JMa mRNA in people with schizophrenia. Our
findings demonstrate that ErbB4-pan laminar mRNA expression is elevated (layers
I, II, V) in schizophrenia. At the cellular level, ErbB4-pan mRNA+ signal was
detected predominantly in interneuron-like neurons. We provide evidence from this
independent Australian postmortem cohort that ErbB4-JMa expression is elevated in
schizophrenia and is linked to deficits in dendrite-targeting somatostatin,
neuropeptide Y and vasoactive intestinal peptide interneurons.

EGFR blocking antibodies are approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer and 
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Although ERBB3 signaling has been 
proposed to limit the effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors, the underlying molecular 
mechanisms are not fully understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we
generated potent blocking antibodies against ERBB3 (REGN1400) and EGFR (REGN955).
We show that EGFR and ERBB3 are coactivated in multiple HNSCC cell lines and that
combined blockade of EGFR and ERBB3 inhibits growth of these cell lines more
effectively than blockade of either receptor alone. Blockade of EGFR with REGN955
strongly inhibited activation of ERK in HNSCC cell lines, whereas blockade of
ERBB3 with REGN1400 strongly inhibited activation of Akt; only the combination of
the 2 antibodies blocked both of these essential downstream pathways. We used a
HER2 blocking antibody to show that ERBB3 phosphorylation in HNSCC and colorectal
cancer cells is strictly dependent on association with HER2, but not EGFR, and
that neuregulin 1 activates ERBB3/HER2 signaling to reverse the effect of EGFR
blockade on colorectal cancer cell growth. Finally, although REGN1400 and REGN955
as single agents slowed the growth of HNSCC and colorectal cancer xenografts, the
combination of REGN1400 plus REGN955 caused significant tumor regression. Our
results indicate that activation of the Akt survival pathway by ERBB3/HER2 limits
the effectiveness of EGFR inhibition, suggesting that REGN1400, which is
currently in a phase I clinical trial, could provide benefit when combined with
EGFR blocking antibodies.

Increasing evidence underscores the strong, rapid, and sustained antidepressant
properties of ketamine with a good tolerability profile in patients with
depression; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated.
Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a bipolar disorder susceptibility gene and a biomarker of 
major depressive disorder, which regulates pyramidal neuron activity via ErbB4 in
parvalbumin interneurons. Moreover, NRG1-ErbB4 signaling is reported to play a
key role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity through regulating the
neurotransmission. We therefore hypothesized that hypofunction of NRG1-ErbB4
signaling in parvalbumin interneurons is involved in the process of ketamine
exerting rapid antidepressant actions in rats subjected to the forced swimming
test (FST). The results showed that ketamine reduced the immobility time and
latency to feed of rats receiving the FST, downregulated the levels of NRG1,
phosphorylated ErbB4 (p-ErbB4), parvalbumin, 67-kDA isoform of glutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD67), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and upregulated the levels
of glutamate in the rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Pretreatment with NRG1
abolished both ketamine's antidepressant effects and ketamine-induced reduction
in p-ErbB4, parvalbumin, GAD67, and GABA levels and increase in glutamate levels.
These results suggest that the downregulation of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in
parvalbumin interneurons in the rat brain may be a mechanism underlying
ketamine's antidepressant properties.

IMPORTANCE: Attenuated ventral striatal response during reward anticipation is a 
core feature of schizophrenia that is seen in prodromal, drug-naive, and chronic 
schizophrenic patients. Schizophrenia is highly heritable, raising the
possibility that this phenotype is related to the genetic risk for the disorder.
OBJECTIVE: To examine a large sample of healthy first-degree relatives of
schizophrenic patients and compare their neural responses to reward anticipation 
with those of carefully matched controls without a family psychiatric history. To
further support the utility of this phenotype, we studied its test-retest
reliability, its potential brain structural contributions, and the effects of a
protective missense variant in neuregulin 1 (NRG1) linked to schizophrenia by
meta-analysis (ie, rs10503929).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Examination of a well-established monetary
reward anticipation paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging at a
university hospital; voxel-based morphometry; test-retest reliability analysis of
striatal activations in an independent sample of 25 healthy participants scanned 
twice with the same task; and imaging genetics analysis of the control group. A
total of 54 healthy first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients and 80
controls matched for demographic, psychological, clinical, and task performance
characteristics were studied.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Blood oxygen level-dependent response during reward
anticipation, analysis of intraclass correlations of functional contrasts, and
associations between striatal gray matter volume and NRG1 genotype.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, healthy first-degree relatives showed a highly
significant decrease in ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation
(familywise error-corrected P < .03 for multiple comparisons across the whole
brain). Supplemental analyses confirmed that the identified systems-level
functional phenotype is reliable (with intraclass correlation coefficients of
0.59-0.73), independent of local gray matter volume (with no corresponding group 
differences and no correlation to function, and with all uncorrected P values
>.05), and affected by the NRG1 genotype (higher striatal responses in controls
with the protective rs10503929 C allele; familywise error-corrected P < .03 for
ventral striatal response).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Healthy first-degree relatives of schizophrenic
patients show altered striatal activation during reward anticipation in a
directionality and localization consistent with prior patient findings. This
provides evidence for a functional neural system mechanism related to familial
risk. The phenotype can be assessed reliably, is independent of alterations in
striatal structure, and is influenced by a schizophrenia candidate gene variant
in NRG1. These data encourage us to further investigate the genetic and molecular
contributions to this phenotype.

Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2/ErbB2 (ERBB2) has been linked
to a poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer; thus, its activity is a
central target for cancer therapy. Likewise, overexpression of heregulin
(HRG/NRG1), a growth factor responsible for ErbB2 activation, has also been shown
to be a driver of breast cancer progression. Although ErbB2 inhibitors offer a
major advancement in the treatment of ErbB2-dependent breast cancers, patients
are highly susceptible to developing clinical resistance to these drugs.
Therefore, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism that underlies
HRG/ErbB2-induced tumorigenesis is essential for the development of effective
therapeutic strategies for this subset of patients with breast cancer. Here, it
was demonstrated that HRG promoted anchorage-independent breast cancer cell
growth more potently than EGF, and that the HRG-dependent activation of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mTORC1 are necessary events for cell
transformation. Functional evaluation of two distinct mTOR (MTOR) inhibitors,
rapamycin and INK-128, on HRG-dependent signaling activities, uncovered a
necessary role for mTORC2 in the regulation of the AKT/TSC2/mTORC1 axis by
affecting the phosphorylation of AKT at the PDK1(PDPK1)-dependent site (T308) as 
well as at the mTORC2-dependent site (S473). The elimination of Rictor (RICTOR), 
a critical component of mTORC2, is detrimental to both the activation of mTORC1
and HRG-mediated cellular transformation. Similar results were obtained in
multiple breast cancer model systems, highlighting an important role for mTORC2
in HRG/ErbB2-dependent breast cancer.IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest the
potential benefits of targeting mTORC2 in HRG/ErbB2-induced breast cancer.

Mutations and polymorphisms in the RET gene are a major cause of Hirschsprung
disease (HSCR). Theoretically, all true heterozygous patients with a new
manifestation of a genetically determined disease must have parents with a
genetic mosaicism of some extent. However, no genetic mosaicism has been
described for the RET gene in HSCR yet. Therefore, we analyzed families with
mutations in the RET gene for genetic mosaicism in the parents of the patients.
Blood samples were taken from patients with HSCR and their families/parents to
sequence the RET coding region. Among 125 families with HSCR, 33 families with
RET mutations were analyzed. In one family, we detected a frameshift mutation due
to a loss of one in a row of four cytosines in codon 117/118 of the RET gene
(c.352delC) leading to a frameshift mutation in the protein (p.Leu118Cysfs*105)
that affected two siblings. In the blood sample of the asymptomatic father we
found a genetic mosaicism of this mutation which was confirmed in two independent
samples of saliva and hair roots. Quantification of peak-heights and comparison
with different mixtures of normal and mutated plasmid DNA suggested that the
mutation occurred in the early morula stadium of the founder, between the 4- and 
8-cell stages. We conclude that the presence of a RET mutation leading to loss of
one functional allele in 20 to 25% of the cells is not sufficient to cause HSCR. 
The possibility of a mosaicism has to be kept in mind during genetic counseling
for inherited diseases.

Cardiac hypertrophy is controlled by a highly connected signaling network with
many effectors of cardiac myocyte size. Quantification of the contribution of
individual pathways to specific changes in shape and transcript abundance is
needed to better understand hypertrophy signaling and to improve heart failure
therapies. We stimulated cardiac myocytes with 15 hypertrophic agonists and
quantitatively characterized differential regulation of 5 shape features using
high-throughput microscopy and transcript levels of 12 genes using qPCR.
Transcripts measured were associated with phenotypes including fibrosis, cell
death, contractility, proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and the fetal
cardiac gene program. While hypertrophy pathways are highly connected, the
agonist screen revealed distinct hypertrophy phenotypic signatures for the 15
receptor agonists. We then used k-means clustering of inputs and outputs to
identify a network map linking input modules to output modules. Five modules were
identified within inputs and outputs with many maladaptive outputs grouping
together in one module: Bax, C/EBPβ, Serca2a, TNFα, and CTGF. Subsequently, we
identified mechanisms underlying two correlations revealed in the agonist screen:
correlation between regulators of fibrosis and cell death signaling (CTGF and Bax
mRNA) caused by AngII; and myocyte proliferation (CITED4 mRNA) and elongation
caused by Nrg1. Follow-up experiments revealed positive regulation of Bax mRNA
level by CTGF and an incoherent feedforward loop linking Nrg1, CITED4 and
elongation. With this agonist screen, we identified the most influential inputs
in the cardiac hypertrophy signaling network for a variety of features related to
pathological and protective hypertrophy signaling and shared regulation among
cardiac myocyte phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: A prolonged isoflurane exposure may lead to cognitive decline in
rodents. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling plays a key role in the modulation
of hippocampal synaptic plasticity through regulating the neurotransmission. The 
authors hypothesized that hippocampal NRG1-ErbB4 signaling is involved in
isoflurane-induced cognitive impairments in aged mice.
METHODS: Fourteen-month-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized to receive 100% O2
exposure, vehicle injection after 100% O2 exposure, vehicle injection after
exposure to isoflurane carried by 100% O2, NRG1-β1 injection after exposure to
isoflurane carried by 100% O2, and NRG1-β1 and an ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478
injection after exposure to isoflurane carried by 100% O2. Fear conditioning test
was used to assess the cognitive function of mice 48-h postexposure. The brain
tissues were harvested 48-h postexposure to determine the levels of NRG1, ErbB4, 
p-ErbB4, parvalbumin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 in the hippocampus using
Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: The percentage of freezing time to context was decreased from 50.28 ±
11.53% to 30.82 ± 10.00%, and the hippocampal levels of NRG1, p-ErbB4/ErbB4,
parvalbumin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 were decreased from 172.79 ±
20.85 ng/g, 69.15 ± 12.20%, 101.68 ± 11.21%, and 104.71 ± 6.85% to 112.92 ± 16.65
ng/g, 42.26 ± 9.71%, 75.89 ± 10.26%, and 73.87 ± 16.89%, respectively, after
isoflurane exposure. NRG1-β1 attenuated the isoflurane-induced
hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairment and the declines in the hippocampal
NRG1, p-ErbB4/ErbB4, parvalbumin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67. AG1478
inhibited the rescuing effects of NRG1-β1.
CONCLUSION: Disruption of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in the parvalbumin-positive
interneurons might, at least partially, contribute to the isoflurane-induced
hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairment after exposure to isoflurane carried
by 100% O2 in aged mice.

Animal models of fragile X syndrome (FXS) suggest the impairment of the
intracellular AKT messenger system, which is activated by neuregulin 1 (NRG1), a 
key regulator of neurodevelopment. We investigated NRG1-induced activation of the
AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) systems by the measurement of
the phosphorylated AKT/ERK to total AKT/ERK ratio in peripheral B lymphoblasts of
patients with FXS, IQ-matched controls with intellectual disability (obstetric
complications, preterm birth, perinatal hypoxia, and low birth weight), and
typically developed healthy participants. Results revealed that patients with FXS
displayed decreased AKT but normal ERK activation after the administration of
NRG1. IQ-matched controls with intellectual disability displayed intact AKT/ERK
activation. In conclusion, FXS, but not intellectual disability associated with
obstetric complications, is associated with decreased NRG1-induced AKT
phosphorylation.

Oxaliplatin causes severe peripheral neuropathy. In this study, we examined
hypomyelination in the peripheral nerve in oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy rat
model. Gene expression of neuregulin 1 (NRG1), a myelination regulatory factor,
is reduced in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in DNA microarray analysis.
Oxaliplatin increased the g-ratio and reduced levels of myelin protein zero in
sciatic nerve, suggesting the hypomyelination. Moreover, oxaliplatin reduced NRG1
mRNA levels in the DRG and decreased levels of cleaved NRG1 type III protein in
the sciatic nerve. Our results indicate that oxaliplatin induces hypomyelination 
and reduced NRG1 expression.

BACKGROUND: Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonates, especially in premature
infants, is one of the main contributors to the mortality of newborns and can
cause nervous system dysfunction in children. The major pathogenesis seems to be 
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in the immature white matter that preferentially
targets vulnerable premyelinating oligodendrocytes.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to culture oligodendrocyte type 2
astrocyte cells in an oxygen and glucose deprivation environment to simulate
ischemia injury and examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the
neuroprotective effects of neuregulin-1ß on ischemia-induced immature
oligodendrocytes.
METHODS: Oligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte cells were cultured from neonatal
Sprague-Dawley rat cerebra. The cells were divided into two groups: one was
subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation for 9 hours and the other was treated
with 50 ng/mL or 100 ng/mL neuregulin-1β during oxygen and glucose deprivation.
Cell survival was determined by Trypan Blue staining and cell apoptosis were
observed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V and propidium iodide double
staining. To study if the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was involved in the
mechanism of protective effect of neuregulin-1ß, Western blot analysis was used
to quantitative the changes of protein.
RESULTS: Treatment with neuregulin-1ß within the period of oxygen and glucose
deprivation significantly increased cell survival and also resulted in a
significant decrease in cell apoptosis. The neuroprotective effects of
neuregulin-1ß were prevented by treatment with Ly294002, an inhibitor of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that neuregulin-1ß could protect the
oligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte progenitors against hypoxic injury, and the
mechanism may be associated with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

Soluble and transmembrane neuregulin 1 isoforms can act as short-range and
long-range attractants for migration of cortical and olfactory interneurons
expressing ErbB4, a tyrosine kinase receptor whose characteristics are strongly
affected by alternative splicing. Here, we have investigated the expression of
the four ErbB4 isoforms and we found that all of them are expressed by neural
progenitor cells migrating from the subventricular zone toward the olfactory bulb
through the rostral migratory stream. We quantified the absolute expression of
the different ErbB4 isoforms and found that all of them are highly expressed in
the regions characterized by high interneuron migration, whereas in the olfactory
bulb regions, where migration stops, ErbB4 isoforms containing exon JMb and
lacking exon cyt1 (called 'cyt2 isoforms') are expressed more than isoforms
containing exons JMa and cyt1. Indeed, we have shown previously that neural
progenitor cells stably expressing ErbB4-JMb-cyt2 have a very low migratory
activity. To investigate whether the different ErbB4 isoforms confer a distinct
adhesion preference for transmembrane neuregulin 1, neural progenitor cells
expressing these were tested in vitro in the stripe choice assay. We found that
each of the four ErbB4 isoforms is able to confer cells with an adhesion
preference for cells expressing the transmembrane neuregulin 1 type III.

The hypothalamus plays a central role in controlling poultry reproductive
activity. To increase our understanding of genes involved in egg laying of Huoyan
geese, gene profiles in the hypothalamus of laying period and ceased period
Huoyan geese were investigated using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) 
method. A total of 95 differentially expressed sequence tags (ESTs), including 46
up-regulated and 49 down-regulated sequences showed homology to known genes of
the non-redundant NCBI databases. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that these 
genes were mainly involved in anatomical structure development, signal
transduction, cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, biosynthetic process,
cellular protein modification process, cell differentiation, transport, cell
adhesion, and reproduction. Ten ESTs were selected for further analyses by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Whose most part of results were
consistent with the SSH results. Of note, AdipoR2, Nrg1, and NCAM1, which related
with secretion of GnRH and other hormones, were identified to be differentially
expressed between laying period and ceased period. These findings provided a new 
source for mining genes related to higher laying performance of Huoyan geese,
which facilitate our understanding of the reproductive biology of the goose.

Activation of MAPK overrides the termination of myelin growth and replaces
Nrg1/ErbB3 signals during Schwann cell development and myelination.

Myelination depends on the synthesis of large amounts of myelin transcripts and
proteins and is controlled by Nrg1/ErbB/Shp2 signaling. We developed a novel
pulse labeling strategy based on stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell
culture (SILAC) to measure the dynamics of myelin protein production in mice. We 
found that protein synthesis is dampened in the maturing postnatal peripheral
nervous system, and myelination then slows down. Remarkably, sustained activation
of MAPK signaling by expression of the Mek1DD allele in mice overcomes the
signals that end myelination, resulting in continuous myelin growth. MAPK
activation leads to minor changes in transcript levels but massively up-regulates
protein production. Pharmacological interference in vivo demonstrates that the
effects of activated MAPK signaling on translation are mediated by
mTOR-independent mechanisms but in part also by mTOR-dependent mechanisms.
Previous work demonstrated that loss of ErbB3/Shp2 signaling impairs Schwann cell
development and disrupts the myelination program. We found that activated MAPK
signaling strikingly compensates for the absence of ErbB3 or Shp2 during Schwann 
cell development and myelination.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis, caused primarily by Candida albicans, presents
significant health issues for women of childbearing age. As a polymorphic fungus,
the ability of C. albicans to switch between yeast and hyphal morphologies is
considered its central virulence attribute. Armed with new criteria for defining 
vaginitis immunopathology, the purpose of this study was to determine whether the
yeast-to-hypha transition is required for the hallmark inflammatory responses
previously characterized during murine vaginitis. Kinetic analyses of vaginal
infection with C. albicans in C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that fungal burdens
remained constant throughout the observation period, while polymorphonuclear
leukocyte (PMN), S100A8, and interleukin-1β levels obtained from vaginal lavage
fluid increased by day 3 onward. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was also
positively correlated with increased effectors of innate immunity. Additionally, 
immunodepletion of neutrophils in infected mice confirmed a nonprotective role
for PMNs during vaginitis. Determination of the importance of fungal
morphogenesis during vaginitis was addressed with a two-pronged approach.
Intravaginal inoculation of mice with C. albicans strains deleted for key
transcriptional regulators (bcr1Δ/Δ, efg1Δ/Δ, cph1Δ/Δ, and efg1Δ/Δ cph1Δ/Δ)
controlling the yeast-to-hypha switch revealed a crucial role for morphogenetic
signaling through the Efg1 and, to a lesser extent, the Bcr1 pathways in
contributing to vaginitis immunopathology. Furthermore, overexpression of
transcription factors NRG1 and UME6, to maintain yeast and hyphal morphologies,
respectively, confirmed the importance of morphogenesis in generating innate
immune responses in vivo. These results highlight the yeast-to-hypha switch and
the associated morphogenetic response as important virulence components for the
immunopathogenesis of Candida vaginitis, with implications for transition from
benign colonization to symptomatic infection.

The mechanisms regulating the differentiation into non-myelinating Schwann cells 
is not completely understood. Recent evidence indicates that GABA-B receptors may
regulate myelination and nociception in the peripheral nervous system. GABA-B
receptor total knock-out mice exhibit morphological and molecular changes in
peripheral myelin. The number of small myelinated fibers is higher and associated
with altered pain sensitivity. Herein, we analyzed whether these changes may be
produced by a specific deletion of GABA-B receptors in Schwann cells. The
conditional mice (P0-GABA-B1(fl/fl)) show a morphological phenotype characterized
by a peculiar increase in the number of small unmyelinated fibers and Remak
bundles, including nociceptive C-fibers. The P0-GABA-B1(fl/fl) mice are
hyperalgesic and allodynic. In these mice, the morphological and behavioral
changes are associated with a downregulation of neuregulin 1 expression in
nerves. Our findings suggest that the altered pain sensitivity derives from a
Schwann cell-specific loss of GABA-B receptor functions, pointing to a role for
GABA-B receptors in the regulation of Schwann cell maturation towards the
non-myelinating phenotype.

We discovered a novel somatic gene fusion, CD74-NRG1, by transcriptome sequencing
of 25 lung adenocarcinomas of never smokers. By screening 102 lung
adenocarcinomas negative for known oncogenic alterations, we found four
additional fusion-positive tumors, all of which were of the invasive mucinous
subtype. Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the
EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-β3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3
receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index
case, and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing
the fusion (P < 0.0001). Ectopic expression of CD74-NRG1 in lung cancer cell
lines expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3 activated ERBB3 and the PI3K-AKT pathway, and
led to increased colony formation in soft agar. Thus, CD74-NRG1 gene fusions are 
activating genomic alterations in invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas and may offer
a therapeutic opportunity for a lung tumor subtype with, so far, no effective
treatment.SIGNIFICANCE: CD74–NRG1 fusions may represent a therapeutic opportunity
for invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinomas, a tumor with no effective treatment
that frequently presents with multifocal unresectable disease.

Quorum sensing controls hyphal initiation in Candida albicans through
Ubr1-mediated protein degradation.

Candida albicans is the most common cause of invasive fungal infections in
humans. Its ability to undergo the morphological transition from yeast to hyphal 
growth forms is critical for its pathogenesis. Hyphal initiation requires the
activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway, which down-regulates the expression of NRG1, 
the major repressor of hyphal development. Hyphal initiation also requires
inoculation of a small amount of C. albicans cells from overnight culture to
fresh medium. This inoculation releases the inhibition from farnesol, a
quorum-sensing molecule of C. albicans, that accumulated in the spent medium.
Here, we show that farnesol inhibits hyphal initiation mainly through blocking
the protein degradation of Nrg1. Through screening a kinase mutant library, we
identified Sok1 as the kinase required for Nrg1 degradation during inoculation.
SOK1 expression is transiently activated on inoculation during hyphal initiation,
and overexpression of SOK1 overcomes the farnesol-mediated inhibition of hyphal
initiation. Screening a collection of transcription factor mutants, the
homeodomain-containing transcription repressor Cup9 is found to be responsible
for the repression of SOK1 expression in response to farnesol inhibition.
Interestingly, farnesol inhibits Cup9 degradation mediated by the N-end rule E3
ubiquitin ligase, Ubr1. Therefore, hyphal initiation requires both the cAMP-PKA
pathway-dependent transcriptional down-regulation of NRG1 and Sok1-mediated
degradation of Nrg1 protein. The latter is triggered by the release from farnesol
inhibition of Cup9 degradation and consequently, derepression of SOK1
transcription. Neither pathway alone is sufficient for hyphal initiation.

Stress has been linked to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Genetic variation in
neuregulin 1 (NRG1) increases the risk of developing schizophrenia and may help
predict which high-risk individuals will transition to psychosis. NRG1 also
modulates sensorimotor gating, a schizophrenia endophenotype. We used an animal
model to demonstrate that partial genetic deletion of Nrg1 interacts with stress 
to promote neurobehavioral deficits of relevance to schizophrenia. Nrg1
heterozygous (HET) mice displayed greater acute stress-induced anxiety-related
behavior than wild-type (WT) mice. Repeated stress in adolescence disrupted the
normal development of higher prepulse inhibition of startle selectively in Nrg1
HET mice but not in WT mice. Further, repeated stress increased dendritic spine
density in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) selectively
in Nrg1 HET mice. Partial genetic deletion of Nrg1 also modulated the adaptive
response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to repeated stress, with Nrg1
HET displaying a reduced repeated stress-induced level of plasma corticosterone
than WT mice. Our results demonstrate that Nrg1 confers vulnerability to repeated
stress-induced sensorimotor gating deficits, dendritic spine growth in the mPFC, 
and an abberant endocrine response in adolescence.

Neuregulin-1 attenuates mortality associated with experimental cerebral malaria.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral Malaria (CM) is a diffuse encephalopathy caused by
Plasmodium falciparum infection. Despite availability of antimalarial drugs,
CM-associated mortality remains high at approximately 30% and a subset of
survivors develop neurological and cognitive disabilities. While antimalarials
are effective at clearing Plasmodium parasites they do little to protect against 
CM pathophysiology and parasite-induced brain inflammation that leads to
seizures, coma and long-term neurological sequelae in CM patients. Thus, there is
urgent need to explore therapeutics that can reduce or prevent CM pathogenesis
and associated brain inflammation to improve survival. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a 
neurotrophic growth factor shown to protect against brain injury associated with 
acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and neurotoxin exposure. However, this drug has not
been tested against CM-associated brain injury. Since CM-associated brain
injuries and AIS share similar pathophysiological features, we hypothesized that 
NRG-1 will reduce or prevent neuroinflammation and brain damage as well as
improve survival in mice with late-stage experimental cerebral malaria (ECM).
METHODS: We tested the effects of NRG-1 on ECM-associated brain inflammation and 
mortality in P. berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected mice and compared to artemether (ARM)
treatment; an antimalarial currently used in various combination therapies
against malaria.
RESULTS: Treatment with ARM (25 mg/kg/day) effectively cleared parasites and
reduced mortality in PbA-infected mice by 82%. Remarkably, NRG-1 therapy
(1.25 ng/kg/day) significantly improved survival against ECM by 73% despite
increase in parasite burden within NRG-1-treated mice. Additionally, NRG-1
therapy reduced systemic and brain pro-inflammatory factors TNFalpha, IL-6,
IL-1alpha and CXCL10 and enhanced anti-inflammatory factors, IL-5 and IL-13 while
decreasing leukocyte accumulation in brain microvessels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NRG-1 attenuates ECM-associated brain
inflammation and injuries and may represent a novel supportive therapy for the
management of CM.

The mammary epithelium is organized as a bilayer of luminal and
basal/myoepithelial cells. During pregnancy, the luminal compartment expands for 
milk production, while basal cells are thought to provide structural and
contractile support. Here, we reveal a pregnancy-specific role of basal epithelia
as a central coordinator of lactogenesis. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of
the transcription factor p63 (Trp63) gene exclusively within basal cells of the
adult gland during pregnancy leads to dramatic defects in luminal cell
proliferation and differentiation, resulting in lactation failure. This phenotype
is explained by direct transcriptional activation of the epidermal growth factor 
family ligand gene Nrg1 by p63 selectively in basal cells, which is required for 
luminal ERBB4/STAT5A activation and consequent luminal progenitor cell
maturation. Thus, paracrine basal-to-luminal cell signaling, controlled by p63
via NRG1, orchestrates the entire lactation program. Collectively, these findings
redefine the paradigm for cellular interactions specifying the functional
maturation of the mammary gland.

Central neuregulin-1/ErbB signaling modulates cardiac function via sympathetic
activity in pressure overload-induced heart failure.

    J Hypertens. 2014 Apr;32(4):735-7.

OBJECTIVES: Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)/ErbB signaling in the heart is reported to have 
a crucial role in heart failure. We recently demonstrated that NRG-1 signaling
has sympathoinhibitory effects in the brain cardiovascular control center. How
this central signaling impacts sympathoexcitation in heart failure, however, is
unknown. Here we examined the role of central NRG-1/ErbB signaling in modulating 
the sympathetic nervous system in pressure overload-induced heart failure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Pressure overload-induced heart failure was induced in
Wistar-Kyoto rats by banding the abdominal aorta. Rats were followed up for 15
weeks. Compared to sham-operated rats, aortic-banded rats showed left ventricle
(LV) hypertrophy, LV dilation, and LV dysfunction [reducing fractional shortening
(%fractional shortening), increased LV end-diastolic pressure, decreased positive
and negative pressure differential (±dp/dt(max))], and increased urinary
norepinephrine excretion. Aortic banding led to reduced expression of NRG-1 in
the brainstem at 10 weeks after banding and reduced expression of ErbB2 at 5
weeks, but did not affect ErbB4. Central administration of recombinant NRG-1β at 
5 weeks for 2 weeks attenuated LV hypertrophy, improved LV dilatation, prevented 
LV dysfunction (improvement of %fractional shortening and ±dp/dt(max), and
reduction of LV end-diastolic pressure), and lowered urinary norepinephrine
excretion at 10 weeks, and these effects were still observed at 15 weeks.
CONCLUSION: NRG-1/ErbB signaling in the brainstem is impaired during the
progression of pressure overload-induced heart failure. Activation of central
NRG-1 signaling improves cardiac function through sympathoinhibition. These
findings provide a new treatment concept and support the benefit of NRG-1
treatment in heart failure.

The neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)/ErbB signaling pathway is a crucial regulator of cardiac
development and plays an important role in the formation of the cardiac special
conduction system. To establish a rat bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC)
cardiomyocyte (CM)-like differentiation model, BMSCs were treated with
5-azacytidine and fibroblast growth factor basic (FGF-basic) for 24 hours and
then cocultured with neonatal rat CMs in a Transwell culture system. The
feasibility of regulating the differentiation of BMSCs into sinoatrial node cells
by manipulating the NRG-1/ErbB pathway was investigated. Three weeks after
induction, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that
inhibition of NRG-1/ErbB signaling (using AG1478) greatly enhanced the expression
of HCN4, Tbx3, and Tbx2. Additionally, Tbx3 protein levels were higher than in
the control group and even produced distinct nodal-type action potentials. The
expression of Nkx2.5 in the NRG-1 group (treated with exogenous NRG-1) was higher
than the other 2 groups. The expression of phospho-Akt was also increased in the 
NRG-1 group but decreased in the AG1478 group. Together, these data demonstrate
that inhibiting the endogenous NRG-1/ErbB signaling pathway when rat BMSCs
differentiate into CMs can greatly enhance the pacemaker phenotype. Akt signaling
may be one of the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these results.

Global signaling effects of a schizophrenia-associated missense mutation in
neuregulin 1: an exploratory study using whole genome and novel kinome

Aberrant neuregulin 1-ErbB4 signaling has been implicated in schizophrenia. We
previously identified a novel schizophrenia-associated missense mutation (valine 
to leucine) in the NRG1 transmembrane domain. This variant inhibits formation of 
the NRG1 intracellular domain (ICD) and causes decreases in dendrite formation.
To assess the global effects of this mutation, we used lymphoblastoid cell lines 
from unaffected heterozygous carriers (Val/Leu) and non-carriers (Val/Val).
Transcriptome data showed 367 genes differentially expressed between the two
groups (Val/Val N = 6, Val/Leu N = 5, T test, FDR (1 %), α = 0.05, -log10 p value
>1.5). Ingenuity pathway (IPA) analyses showed inflammation and NRG1 signaling as
the top pathways altered. Within NRG1 signaling, protein kinase C (PKC)-eta
(PRKCH) and non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) were down-regulated in
heterozygous carriers. Novel kinome profiling (serine/threonine) was performed
after stimulating cells (V/V N = 6, V/L N = 6) with ErbB4, to induce release of
the NRG1 ICD, and revealed significant effects of treatment on the
phosphorylation of 35 peptides. IPA showed neurite outgrowth (six peptides) as
the top annotated function. Phosphorylation of these peptides was significantly
decreased in ErbB4-treated Val/Val but not in Val/Leu cells. These results show
that perturbing NRG1 ICD formation has major effects on cell signaling, including
inflammatory and neurite formation pathways, and may contribute significantly to 
schizophrenia pathophysiology.

Fate determination of neural crest cells is an essential step for the development
of different crest cell derivatives. Peripheral glia development is marked by the
choice of the neural crest cells to differentiate along glial lineages. The
molecular mechanism underlying fate acquisition is poorly understood. However,
recent advances have identified different transcription factors and genes
required for the complex instructive signaling process that comprise both local
environmental and cell intrinsic cues. Among others, at least the roles of Sox10,
Notch, and neuregulin 1 have been documented in both in vivo and in vitro models.
Cooperative interactions of such factors appear to be necessary for the switch
from multipotent neural crest cells to glial lineage precursors in the peripheral
nervous system. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of
fate determination of neural crest cells into different glia subtypes, together
with the potential implications in regenerative medicine.

Both neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ErbB4 are susceptibility genes for
schizophrenia. Reduced synchronization of evoked oscillations in several cortical
regions, especially in the prefrontal cortex, is associated with the core
symptoms of schizophrenia. Recent studies have reported that NRG1 may affect the 
hippocampal oscillations. However, the role of NRG1/ErbB4 signaling in the
synchronization of neurons in the prefrontal cortex is unclear. Here, we found
that NRG1 enhanced the synchrony of pyramidal neurons via presynaptic
interneurons. Meanwhile, NRG1 also increased the synchrony between pairs of
fast-spiking interneurons and pairs of fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking
interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, and this effect was mediated by ErbB4
receptors. Moreover, the NRG1-enhanced synchrony of interneurons was through
their mutually-inhibitory synapses but not electrical coupling. Furthermore,
kainate-induced gamma oscillations in vivo were enhanced by NRG1 and did not
change in Dlx5/6-ErbB4(-/-) mice in which the ErbB4 receptors were specifically
knocked out in interneurons of the frontal brain. Overall, our findings suggested
that NRG1/ErbB4 signaling plays an important role in the synchronized
oscillations of the whole network in the prefrontal cortex that are impaired in
schizophrenia.

Axonal sorting is a crucial event in nerve formation and requires proper Schwann 
cell proliferation, differentiation, and contact with axons. Any defect in axonal
sorting results in dysmyelinating peripheral neuropathies. Evidence from mouse
models shows that axonal sorting is regulated by laminin211- and, possibly,
neuregulin 1 (Nrg1)-derived signals. However, how these signals are integrated in
Schwann cells is largely unknown. We now report that the nuclear Jun activation
domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) may transduce laminin211 signals to regulate
Schwann cell number and differentiation during axonal sorting. Mice with
inactivation of Jab1 in Schwann cells develop a dysmyelinating neuropathy with
axonal sorting defects. Loss of Jab1 increases p27 levels in Schwann cells, which
causes defective cell cycle progression and aberrant differentiation. Genetic
down-regulation of p27 levels in Jab1-null mice restores Schwann cell number,
differentiation, and axonal sorting and rescues the dysmyelinating neuropathy.
Thus, Jab1 constitutes a regulatory molecule that integrates laminin211 signals
in Schwann cells to govern cell cycle, cell number, and differentiation. Finally,
Jab1 may constitute a key molecule in the pathogenesis of dysmyelinating
neuropathies.

Axonal surface proteins encompass a group of heterogeneous molecules, which exert
a variety of different functions in the highly interdependent relationship
between axons and Schwann cells. We recently revealed that the tumour suppressor 
protein merlin, mutated in the hereditary tumour syndrome neurofibromatosis type 
2, impacts significantly on axon structure maintenance in the peripheral nervous 
system. We now report on a role of neuronal merlin in the regulation of the
axonal surface protein neuregulin 1 important for modulating Schwann cell
differentiation and myelination. Specifically, neuregulin 1 type III expression
is reduced in sciatic nerve tissue of neuron-specific knockout animals as well as
in biopsies from seven patients with neurofibromatosis type 2. In vitro
experiments performed on both the P19 neuronal cell line and primary dorsal root 
ganglion cells demonstrate the influence of merlin on neuregulin 1 type III
expression. Moreover, expression of ERBB2, a Schwann cell receptor for neuregulin
1 ligands is increased in nerve tissue of both neuron-specific merlin knockout
animals and patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, demonstrating for the first
time that axonal merlin indirectly regulates Schwann cell behaviour.
Collectively, we have identified that neuronally expressed merlin can influence
Schwann cell activity in a cell-extrinsic manner.

Many studies have identified binding preferences for transcription factors (TFs),
but few have yielded predictive models of how combinations of transcription
factor binding sites generate specific levels of gene expression. Synthetic
promoters have emerged as powerful tools for generating quantitative data to
parameterize models of combinatorial cis-regulation. We sought to improve the
accuracy of such models by quantifying the occupancy of TFs on synthetic
promoters in vivo and incorporating these data into statistical thermodynamic
models of cis-regulation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq, we measured
the occupancy of Gcn4 and Cbf1 in synthetic promoter libraries composed of
binding sites for Gcn4, Cbf1, Met31/Met32 and Nrg1. We measured the occupancy of 
these two TFs and the expression levels of all promoters in two growth
conditions. Models parameterized using only expression data predicted expression 
but failed to identify several interactions between TFs. In contrast, models
parameterized with occupancy and expression data predicted expression data, and
also revealed Gcn4 self-cooperativity and a negative interaction between Gcn4 and
Nrg1. Occupancy data also allowed us to distinguish between competing regulatory 
mechanisms for the factor Gcn4. Our framework for combining occupancy and
expression data produces predictive models that better reflect the mechanisms
underlying combinatorial cis-regulation of gene expression.

The NRG/erbB pathway has emerged as an important therapeutic target for cancer
growth as well as cardiac related diseases. This discovery stems back to findings
showing that overexpression of erbB2 receptors increases the metastatic potential
of breast cancer in patients. Blocking this receptor using a monoclonal antibody 
(trastuzumab) inhibits tumor growth and offers significantly improved outcomes.
However, excitement over this discovery was tempered by data showing that
trastuzumab-treated patients have an increased risk of developing cardiac
dysfunction, limiting the clinical potential of this novel agent. This finding
suggested an important protective effect of the erbB signaling pathway on cardiac
survival and homeostasis. Further investigation has shown that
endothelial-derived neuregulin (a key ligand for erbB receptors) has a protective
paracrine effect on cardiac cells as well as vascular smooth muscle cells in the 
setting of an injury. Since endothelial cells contain erbB receptors, they are
also targets for autocrine signaling via this pathway, an important mediator of
vascular preservation and angiogenic responses of endothelium. In this review we 
summarize important clinical findings as well as animal and cellular models that 
illustrate the signaling pathways involved in vascular cell regulation of
cardiomyocyte survival and angiogenesis via the NRG/erbB pathway.

Paracrine and juxtacrine signaling via proteins expressed on the cell surface are
an integral part of metazoan biology. More than one-half billion years ago
epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its cognate receptor formed a functional
binding partnership, which has been conserved through evolution in essentially
all eubilaterate members of the animal kingdom. Early chordates spawned offspring
of these seminal genes to begin the creation of new gene families and an expanded
cell-cell signaling network, which included the Neuregulin (NRG) ligands and the 
erbB receptors. First appearance of ancestral NRG, represented in a NRG4-like
gene in the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, appears to have: 1) occurred in the 
common chordate ancestor prior to the divergence of lancelets (amphioxus), and;
2) antedated the formation of the receptor gene family. Orthologues of NRG1 and
multiple erbB receptors found in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus suggest that 
several key events, which were required to expand and diversify these gene
families, occurred in the common ancestor of agnathostomes and jawed vertebrates.
These important inventions surely played major roles in the acquisition of
multiple apomorphic features of the emerging vertebrate lineage.

The Erk MAP kinase pathway is activated at muscle spindles and is required for
induction of the muscle spindle-specific gene Egr3 by neuregulin1.

Muscle spindles are sensory receptors composed of specialized muscle fibers,
known as intrafusal muscle fibers, along with the endings of sensory neuron axons
that innervate these muscle fibers. Formation of muscle spindles requires
neuregulin1 (NRG1), which is released by sensory axons, activating ErbB receptors
in muscle cells that are contacted. The transcription factor Egr3 is
transcriptionally induced by NRG1, which in turn activates various target genes
involved in forming intrafusal fibers. We have previously shown that, in cultured
muscle cells, NRG1 signaling activates the Egr3 gene through SRF and CREB, which 
bind to a composite regulatory element, and that NRG1 signaling targets SRF by
stimulating nuclear translocation of SRF coactivators myocardin-related
transcription factor (MRTF)-A and MRTF-B and targets CREB by phosphorylation. The
current studies examined signaling relays that might function in the NRG1 pathway
upstream of SRF and CREB. We found that transcriptional induction of Egr3 in
response to NRG1 requires the MAP kinase Erk1/2, which acts upstream of CREB to
induce its phosphorylation. MRTFs are targeted by the Rho-actin pathway, yet in
the absence of Rho-actin signaling, even though MRTFs fail to be translocated to 
the nucleus, NRG1 induces Egr3 transcription. In mouse muscle in vivo, activation
of Erk1/2 is enhanced selectively where muscle spindles are located. These
results suggest that Erk1/2 acts in intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles to
induce transcription of Egr3 and that Egr3 induction occurs independently of
MRTFs and involves Erk1/2 acting on other transcriptional regulatory targets that
interact with the SRF-CREB regulatory element.

Neuregulin-1/glial growth factor stimulates Schwann cell migration by inducing α5
β1 integrin-ErbB2-focal adhesion kinase complex formation.

Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, 4-1-1 Ogawa-higashi,
Kodaira, Tokyo, 187-8502, Japan.

After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells gain a migratory phenotype and
remodel their extracellular matrix to provide a supportive environment for axonal
regeneration. The soluble neuregulin-1 isoform, that is, glial growth factor
(GGF), is expressed in regenerating axons of injured peripheral nerves and
regulates Schwann cell motility by activating the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase 
receptors, but how GGF/ErbB signaling contributes to Schwann cell motility
remains unclear. Here, we show that GGF stimulates Schwann cell migration by
inducing the formation of a protein complex containing the fibronectin receptor
α5β1 integrin, ErbB2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). ErbB2 co-localizes and
co-immunoprecipitates with the focal complex members including α5β1 integrin and 
FAK after GGF treatment. These effects of GGF appear to involve FAK activation,
which occurs downstream of ErbB2 stimulation. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of α5
integrin expression in primary cultured Schwann cells resulted in significantly
decreased interaction between FAK and ErbB2, as well as decreased GGF-induced
migration. An increase in the α5β1 integrin-ErbB2-FAK complex formation was
observed in injured nerve Schwann cells, but not uninjured control. Taken
together, these data suggest that GGF plays an important modulatory role in
Schwann cell migration after nerve crush by inducing α5β1 integrin-ErbB2-FAK
complex formation.

Neuregulin as a heart failure therapy and mediator of reverse remodeling.

Galindo CL, Ryzhov S, Sawyer DB.

The beta isoform of Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1β), along with its receptors (ErbB2-4), is
required for cardiac development. NRG-1β, as well as the ErbB2 and ErbB4
receptors, is also essential for maintenance of adult heart function. These
observations have led to its evaluation as a therapeutic for heart failure.
Animal studies and ongoing clinical trials have demonstrated beneficial effects
of two forms of recombinant NRG-1β on cardiac function. In addition to the
possible role for recombinant NRG-1βs as heart failure therapies, endogenous
NRG-1β/ErbB signaling appears to play a role in restoring cardiac function after 
injury. The potential mechanisms by which NRG-1β may act as both a therapy and a 
mediator of reverse remodeling remain incompletely understood. In addition to
direct effects on cardiac myocytes NRG-1β acts on the vasculature, interstitium, 
cardiac fibroblasts, and hematopoietic and immune cells, which, collectively, may
contribute to NRG-1β's role in maintaining cardiac structure and function, as
well as mediating reverse remodeling.

Neuregulin-1 overexpression and Trp53 haploinsufficiency cooperatively promote de
novo malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor pathogenesis.

Brosius SN, Turk AN, Byer SJ, Brossier NM, Kohli L, Whitmire A, Mikhail FM, Roth 
KA, Carroll SL.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are Schwann cell-derived
malignancies that arise from plexiform neurofibromas in patients with mutation of
the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. We have shown that the growth factor neuregulin-1
(NRG1) also contributes to human neurofibroma and MPNST pathogenesis and that
outbred C57BL/6J × SJL/J transgenic mice overexpressing NRG1 in Schwann cells
(P0-GGFβ3 mice) recapitulate the process of neurofibroma-MPNST progression.
However, it is unclear whether NRG1 acts predominantly within NF1-regulated
signaling cascades or instead activates other essential cascades that cooperate
with NF1 loss to promote tumorigenesis. We now report that tumorigenesis is
suppressed in inbred P0-GGFβ3 mice on a C57BL/6J background. To determine whether
NRG1 overexpression interacts with reduced Nf1 or Trp53 gene dosage to "unmask"
tumorigenesis in these animals, we followed cohorts of inbred P0-GGFβ3;Nf1+/−,
P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/− and control (P0-GGFβ3, Nf1+/− and Trp53+/−) mice for 1 year. We
found no reduction in survival or tumors in control and P0-GGFβ3;Nf1+/− mice. In 
contrast, P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/− mice died on average at 226 days, with MPNSTs present
in 95 % of these mice. MPNSTs in inbred P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/− mice arose de novo from
micro-MPNSTs that uniformly develop intraganglionically. These micro-MPNSTs are
of lower grade (WHO grade II-III) than the major MPNSTs (WHO grade III-IV); array
comparative genomic hybridization showed that lower grade MPNSTs also had fewer
genomic abnormalities. Thus, P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/− mice represent a novel model of
low- to high-grade MPNST progression. We further conclude that NRG1 promotes
peripheral nervous system neoplasia predominantly via its effects on the
signaling cascades affected by Nf1 loss.

Activation of microglial neuregulin1 signaling in the corticospinal tracts of ALS
patients with upper motor neuron signs.

Song F(1), Chiang P, Ravits J, Loeb JA.

Author information: 
(1)Hiller ALS Center.

We recently found neuregulin1 (NRG1) receptors are activated on microglia in the 
ventral horn of both ALS patients and SOD1 mice, suggesting a common pathological
mechanism. However, it is not clear whether this signaling system also plays a
role in patients with upper motor neuron (UMN) features, where patients show
significant pathological changes in the corticospinal tracts (CSTs). Since the
connection between upper and lower motor neuron (LMN) systems in ALS patients is 
not readily seen in the SOD1 mouse, we examined the lateral and ventral CSTs for 
NRG1 receptor activation and NRG1 expression in ALS patients with UMN symptoms
compared to control patients with no evidence of neurodegenerative disease. We
found that ALS patients with UMN symptoms showed increased microglial activation 
that colocalized with NRG1 receptor activation in the lateral and ventral CSTs.
These same regions also showed increased NRG1 protein expression locally but no
change in NRG1 mRNA. In conclusion, these data suggest that increased NRG1
protein accumulation could contribute to UMN disease through microglial
activation in the CSTs.

FGF7 signals are relayed to autocrine EGF family growth factors to induce
branching morphogenesis of mouse salivary epithelium.

Kera H(1), Yuki S, Nogawa H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Graduate School of Science, Chiba University, Chiba,
Japan.

BACKGROUND: The Matrigel-embedded epithelium of the mouse submandibular gland
undergoes branching morphogenesis when cultured in medium supplemented with
fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), whereas it
elongates a stalk with limited branching in medium with only FGF7. Because LPA is
a well-known activator of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, we
hypothesized the involvement of autocrine EGF family growth factors in the
branching morphogenesis.
RESULTS: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies showed that
three members, Tgfa, Hbegf,and Nrg1 of the EGF family were expressed in the
epithelium cultured with FGF7 + LPA as well as in the epithelium freshly isolated
from the rudiments. All the growth factors induced extensive branching
morphogenesis in the Matrigel-embedded epithelium in the presence of LPA.
Tyrphostin AG112, an inhibitor of EGF signaling, severely impaired branching
morphogenesis induced by FGF7 + LPA without exogenous addition of EGF family
growth factors to the culture medium. The shaking cultures, which were expected
to decrease the concentration of autocrine growth factors near the epithelium by 
promoting their diffusion, significantly reduced branching morphogenesis induced 
by FGF7 + LPA.
CONCLUSIONS: Autocrine EGF family growth factors are involved in epithelial
branching morphogenesis induced by FGF7 + LPA.

Stress and trauma: BDNF control of dendritic-spine formation and regression.

Chronic restraint stress leads to increases in brain derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) mRNA and protein in some regions of the brain, e.g. the basal lateral
amygdala (BLA) but decreases in other regions such as the CA3 region of the
hippocampus and dendritic spine density increases or decreases in line with these
changes in BDNF. Given the powerful influence that BDNF has on dendritic spine
growth, these observations suggest that the fundamental reason for the direction 
and extent of changes in dendritic spine density in a particular region of the
brain under stress is due to the changes in BDNF there. The most likely cause of 
these changes is provided by the stress initiated release of steroids, which
readily enter neurons and alter gene expression, for example that of BDNF. Of
particular interest is how glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids tend to have
opposite effects on BDNF gene expression offering the possibility that
differences in the distribution of their receptors and of their downstream
effects might provide a basis for the differential transcription of the BDNF
genes. Alternatively, differences in the extent of methylation and acetylation in
the epigenetic control of BDNF transcription are possible in different parts of
the brain following stress. Although present evidence points to changes in BDNF
transcription being the major causal agent for the changes in spine density in
different parts of the brain following stress, steroids have significant effects 
on downstream pathways from the TrkB receptor once it is acted upon by BDNF,
including those that modulate the density of dendritic spines. Finally, although 
glucocorticoids play a canonical role in determining BDNF modulation of dendritic
spines, recent studies have shown a role for corticotrophin releasing factor
(CRF) in this regard. There is considerable improvement in the extent of changes 
in spine size and density in rodents with forebrain specific knockout of CRF
receptor 1 (CRFR1) even when the glucocorticoid pathways are left intact. It
seems then that CRF does have a role to play in determining BDNF control of
dendritic spines.

Comment in
    Biol Psychiatry. 2014 Jul 15;76(2):89-90.

BACKGROUND: Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) is a pleiotropic signaling molecule that
regulates neural development, and mutation of Nrg1 is a risk factor for
schizophrenia. Cleavage of type I β1 Nrg1 isoform by Bace1 releases a secreted
N-terminal fragment (Nrg1-ntfβ), which can bind to a cognate ErbB receptor to
activate the specific signaling cascade. This study aimed to determine whether
increased expression of Nrg1 is beneficial for brain development and functions.
METHODS: We generated transgenic mice overexpressing this fragment under the
control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter and examined functional and
behavioral changes in mice upon reversible expression of the transgene.
RESULTS: Increased expression of full-length Nrg1 in mouse neurons has been
previously shown to enhance myelination in the central nervous system.
Overexpressing Nrg1-ntfβ enhanced the expression of myelin proteins, consistent
with the expected activation of the Nrg1 signaling pathway by Nrg1-ntfβ. Contrary
to expectations, overexpressing Nrg1-ntfβ transgene caused schizophrenia-like
behaviors in transgenic mice, and these abnormal behaviors were reversible if the
expression of the Nrg1-ntfβ transgene was turned off. Our molecular assay
suggests that protein levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are reduced in
this transgenic mouse model, which might underlie the observed social and
cognitive behavioral impairments.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that overexpressing the secreted form of Nrg1
is sufficient to cause schizophrenia-like behaviors in a mouse model, meaning the
effect is independent of the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of Nrg1. Hence,
genetic gain-of-function mutations of Nrg1 are also risk factors for
schizophrenia.

Acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF1) and neuregulin-1 (NRG1) are growth factors
involved in cardiac development and regeneration. Microparticles (MPs) mediate
cytokine sustained release, and can be utilized to overcome issues related to the
limited therapeutic protein stability during systemic administration. We sought
to examine whether the administration of microparticles (MPs) containing FGF1 and
NRG1 could promote cardiac regeneration in a myocardial infarction (MI) rat
model. We investigated the possible underlying mechanisms contributing to the
beneficial effects of this therapy, especially those linked to endogenous
regeneration. FGF1- and NRG1-loaded MPs were prepared using a multiple emulsion
solvent evaporation technique. Seventy-three female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent
permanent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, and MPs were
intramyocardially injected in the peri-infarcted zone four days later. Cardiac
function, heart tissue remodeling, revascularization, apoptosis, cardiomyocyte
proliferation, and stem cell homing were evaluated one week and three months
after treatment. MPs were shown to efficiently encapsulate FGF1 and NRG1,
releasing the bioactive proteins in a sustained manner. Three months after
treatment, a statistically significant improvement in cardiac function was
detected in rats treated with growth factor-loaded MPs (FGF1, NRG1, or
FGF1/NRG1). The therapy led to inhibition of cardiac remodeling with smaller
infarct size, a lower fibrosis degree and induction of tissue revascularization. 
Cardiomyocyte proliferation and progenitor cell recruitment were detected. Our
data support the therapeutic benefit of NRG1 and FGF1 when combined with protein 
delivery systems for cardiac regeneration. This approach could be scaled up for
use in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

In the present study, we investigated the anticancer effects of the mitochondrial
inhibitors, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), metformin and phenformin. 131I-MIBG
has been used for scintigraphic detection and the targeted radiotherapy of
neuroblastoma (NB), a pediatric malignancy. Non-radiolabeled MIBG has been
reported to be cytotoxic to NB cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the
mechanisms behind its growth suppressive effects have not yet been fully
elucidated. Metformin and phenformin are diabetes medications that are being
considered in anticancer therapeutics. We investigated the anticancer mechanisms 
of action of MIBG and metformin in NB. Our data revealed that both drugs
suppressed NB cell growth and that the combination drug treatment was more
potent. MIBG reduced MYCN and MYC expression in MYCN-amplified and
non-MYCN-amplified NB cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Metformin was
less effective than MIBG in destabilizing MYC/MYCN. The treatment of NB cells
with metformin or MIBG resulted in an increased expression of genes encoding
biomarkers for favorable outcome in NB [(ephrin (EFN)B2, EFNB3, EPH receptor B6
(EPHB6), neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 1 (NTRK1), CD44 and
Myc-interacting zinc finger protein (MIZ-1)] and tumor suppressor genes [(early
growth response 1 (EGR1), EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2), growth arrest and
DNA-damage-inducible, beta (GADD45B), neuregulin 1 (NRG1), TP53 apoptosis
effector (PERP) and sel-1 suppressor of lin-12-like (C. elegans) (SEL1L)].
Accordingly, metformin and MIBG augmented histone H3 acetylation in these cells. 
Phenformin also exhibited histone modification and was more effective than
metformin in destabilizing MYC/MYCN in NB cells. Our data suggest that the
destabilization of MYC/MYCN by MIBG, metformin and phenformin and their effects
on histone modification are important mechanisms underlying their anticancer
effects.

Currently, only patients with HER2-positive tumors are candidates for
HER2-targeted therapies. However, recent clinical observations suggest that the
survival of patients with HER2-low breast cancers, who lack HER2 amplification,
may benefit from adjuvant therapy that targets HER2. In this study, we explored a
mechanism through which these benefits may be obtained. Prompted by the
hypothesis that HER2/HER3 signaling in breast tumor-initiating cells (TIC)
promotes self-renewal and survival, we obtained evidence that neuregulin 1 (NRG1)
produced by TICs promotes their proliferation and self-renewal in HER2-low
tumors, including in triple-negative breast tumors. Pharmacologic inhibition of
EGFR, HER2, or both receptors reduced breast TIC survival and self-renewal in
vitro and in vivo and increased TIC sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Through a 
tissue microarray analysis, we found that NRG1 expression and associated HER2
activation occurred in a subset of HER2-low breast cancers. Our results offer an 
explanation for why HER2 inhibition blocks the growth of HER2-low breast tumors. 
Moreover, they argue that dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 may offer a useful
therapeutic strategy to target TICs in these tumors. In generating a mechanistic 
rationale to apply HER2-targeting therapies in patients with HER2-low tumors,
this work shows why these therapies could benefit a considerably larger number of
patients with breast cancer than they currently reach.

Neuroblastoma is a common pediatric solid tumor that exhibits a striking clinical
bipolarity: favorable and unfavorable. The survival rate of children with
unfavorable neuroblastoma remains low among all childhood cancers. MYCN and MYC
play a crucial role in determining the malignancy of unfavorable neuroblastomas, 
whereas high-level expression of the favorable neuroblastoma genes is associated 
with a good disease outcome and confers growth suppression of neuroblastoma
cells. A small fraction of neuroblastomas harbors TP53 mutations at diagnosis,
but a higher proportion of the relapse cases acquire TP53 mutations. In this
study, we investigated the effect of S(+)-ibuprofen on neuroblastoma cell lines, 
focusing on the expression of the MYCN, MYC, AKT, p53 proteins and the favorable 
neuroblastoma genes in vitro as biomarkers of malignancy. Treatment of
neuroblastoma cell lines with S(+)-ibuprofen resulted in a significant growth
suppression. This growth effect was accompanied by a marked decrease in the
expression of MYC, MYCN, AKT and an increase in p53 expression in neuroblastoma
cell lines without TP53 mutation. In addition, S(+)-ibuprofen enhanced the
expression of some favorable neuroblastoma genes (EPHB6, CD44) and genes involved
in growth suppression and differentiation (EGR1, EPHA2, NRG1 and SEL1L). Gene
expression profile and Ingenuity pathway analyses using TP53-mutated SKNAS cells 
further revealed that S(+)-ibuprofen suppressed molecular pathways associated
with cell growth and conversely enhanced those of cell cycle arrest and the
unfolded protein response. Collectively, these results suggest that
S(+)-ibuprofen or its related compounds may have the potential for therapeutic
and/or palliative use for unfavorable neuroblastoma.

aid early identification and treatment of psychotic disorders. Previous studies
have typically utilized cross-sectional study designs and have focused on
individuals with psychotic disorders. Thus, examination of promising correlates
of psychotic symptoms using longitudinal designs among more broadly defined
populations is warranted. Two such correlates are neuregulin-1 (NRG1) genotypic
variation and depression symptom severity. Both NRG1 and depression symptom
severity have cross-sectional evidence for an association with psychosis but
their affect on longitudinal patterns of psychotic symptoms and their potential
interaction effects are less clear. Using repeated measures analysis of variance 
and covariance we modeled the main and interaction effects of NRG1 genotypic
variation and depressive symptom severity on longitudinal psychotic symptom
patterns in 301 primary care attendees assessed annually over 4 years. One-fifth 
(19.9%) of the participants reported one or more psychotic symptoms over the
4-year assessment period. We observed a curvilinear (i.e., cubic) association
between depression symptom severity at baseline and longitudinal patterns of
psychotic symptoms but did not observe a main effect for NRG1 genotypic variation
on psychotic symptom patterns. However, NRG1 rs6994992 genotype moderated the
curvilinear association between depression symptom severity and psychotic symptom
patterns. Specifically, depression symptom severity had less of an effect on
longitudinal psychotic symptoms among carriers of the rs6994992 TT genotype
compared to CC and CT carriers. Our findings suggest a curvilinear association
between depression symptom severity and longitudinal patterns of psychotic
symptoms that is moderated by NRG1 genotype.

Physical activity plays an important role in preventing chronic disease in adults
and the elderly. Exercise has beneficial effects on the nervous system, including
at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Exercise causes hypertrophy of NMJs and
improves recovery from peripheral nerve injuries, whereas decreased physical
activity causes degenerative changes in NMJs. Recent studies have begun to
elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise.
These mechanisms involve Bassoon, neuregulin-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma coactivator 1α, insulin-like growth factor-1, glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin 4, Homer, and nuclear factor of
activated T cells c1. For example, NMJ denervation and active zone decreases have
been observed in aged NMJs, but these age-dependent degenerative changes can be
ameliorated by exercise. In this review we assess the effects of exercise on the 
maintenance and regeneration of NMJs and highlight recent insights into the
molecular mechanisms underlying these exercise effects.

Misregulation of acid-base transport plays central roles in cancer development.
We previously demonstrated the strong up-regulation of the Na(+),HCO3(-)
cotransporter NBCn1 (SLC4A7) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by a truncated,
constitutively active ErbB2 (HER2) receptor, ΔNErbB2, and showed that NBCn1
expression and activity are increased in breast cancer tissue from patients.
Here, we present the first in-depth characterization of an SLC4A7 promoter and
identify its minimal ΔNErbB2-sensitive region. Inhibition or siRNA-mediated
knockdown of PI3K, Akt1, ERK1/2, or Src decreased the NBCn1 protein level in
ΔNErbB2-expressing MCF-7 cells by ~50, 60, 30 and 35%, respectively. Further,
knockdown of the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) reduced NBCn1 
protein expression by ~40%, and KLF4 overexpression increased NBCn1 expression by
50-80%. In contrast, knockdown of the closely related transcription factor
specificity protein 1 (Sp1) or transfection with dominant-negative Sp1 increased 
NBCn1 expression by ~35 and ~50%, respectively. NBCn1 expression was also
increased by stimulation of full-length ErbB1, -2, and -3 receptors in SKBr3
cells (1.5- and 2-fold by NRG1 or EGF, respectively) or after their exogenous
expression in MCF-7 cells. Finally, stimulation with NRG1 or EGF more than
doubled acid extrusion capacity in SKBr3 cells. In conclusion, NBCn1 is strongly 
upregulated by ErbB receptor signaling in a manner involving opposite effects of 
KLF4 and Sp1, transcription factors with central roles in cancer development.
ErbB-induced up-regulation of NBCn1-mediated acid extrusion may play important
physiological and pathophysiological roles in the breast epithelium and other
tissues with high ErbB receptor levels.

The objective of the study was to investigate the role of neuregulin-ErbB
signaling in neuropathic pain in different types of injury. Neuregulin-1(NRG-1)
was injected into animals with either formalin-induced pain model or spared nerve
injury (SNI) model. Formalin tests or paw withdrawal tests were performed to
study the role of NRG-1 in neuropathic pain. siRNA specific to different erbB
receptors were then introduced to test which specific signaling pathway was
required for NRG-1 signaling in the different pain models. NRG-1 inhibits
neuropathic pain after SNI in a dose-dependent manner, while NRG-1 aggravates
formalin-induced neuropathic pain. ErbB2 and erbB4 receptors were activated after
neuregulin administration. Knockdown of ErbB2 relieves the aggravation of NRG-1
on formalin-induced neuropathic pain, and knockdown of ErbB4 could relieve the
inhibition of NRG-1 on neuropathic pain in the SNI model. NRG-1 has two distinct 
functions depending on the different receptor activation in different models of
neuropathic pain. These novel findings may provide new therapeutic approaches for
the treatment of neuropathic pain in different injury types.

Studies in adolescents and adults have demonstrated that polymorphisms in
putative psychiatric risk genes are associated with differences in brain
structure, but cannot address when in development these relationships arise. To
determine if common genetic variants in disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (DISC1;
rs821616 and rs6675281), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; rs4680), neuregulin 
1 (NRG1; rs35753505 and rs6994992), apolipoprotein E (APOE; ε3ε4 vs. ε3ε3),
estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1; rs9340799 and rs2234693), brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF; rs6265), and glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1;
rs2270335) are associated with individual differences in brain tissue volumes in 
neonates, we applied both automated region-of-interest volumetry and tensor-based
morphometry to a sample of 272 neonates who had received high-resolution magnetic
resonance imaging scans. ESR1 (rs9340799) predicted intracranial volume. Local
variation in gray matter (GM) volume was significantly associated with
polymorphisms in DISC1 (rs821616), COMT, NRG1, APOE, ESR1 (rs9340799), and BDNF. 
No associations were identified for DISC1 (rs6675281), ESR1 (rs2234693), or GAD1.
Of note, neonates homozygous for the DISC1 (rs821616) serine allele exhibited
numerous large clusters of reduced GM in the frontal lobes, and neonates
homozygous for the COMT valine allele exhibited reduced GM in the temporal cortex
and hippocampus, mirroring findings in adults. The results highlight the
importance of prenatal brain development in mediating psychiatric risk.

AIMS: It is a dogma of cardiovascular pathophysiology that the increased cardiac 
mass in response to increased workload is produced by the hypertrophy of the
pre-existing myocytes. The role, if any, of adult-resident endogenous cardiac
stem/progenitor cells (eCSCs) and new cardiomyocyte formation in physiological
cardiac remodelling remains unexplored.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In response to regular, intensity-controlled exercise
training, adult rats respond with hypertrophy of the pre-existing myocytes. In
addition, a significant number (∼7%) of smaller newly formed BrdU-positive
cardiomyocytes are produced by the exercised animals. Capillary density
significantly increased in exercised animals, balancing cardiomyogenesis with
neo-angiogenesis. c-kit(pos) eCSCs increased their number and activated state in 
exercising vs. sedentary animals. c-kit(pos) eCSCs in exercised hearts showed an 
increased expression of transcription factors, indicative of their commitment to 
either the cardiomyocyte (Nkx2.5(pos)) or capillary (Ets-1(pos)) lineages. These 
adaptations were dependent on exercise duration and intensity. Insulin-like
growth factor-1, transforming growth factor-β1, neuregulin-1, bone morphogenetic 
protein-10, and periostin were significantly up-regulated in cardiomyocytes of
exercised vs. sedentary animals. These factors differentially stimulated
c-kit(pos) eCSC proliferation and commitment in vitro, pointing to a similar role
in vivo.
CONCLUSION: Intensity-controlled exercise training initiates myocardial
remodelling through increased cardiomyocyte growth factor expression leading to
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and to activation and ensuing differentiation of
c-kit(pos) eCSCs. This leads to the generation of new myocardial cells. These
findings highlight the endogenous regenerative capacity of the adult heart,
represented by the eCSCs, and the fact that the physiological cardiac adaptation 
to exercise stress is a combination of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia 
(cardiomyocytes and capillaries).
