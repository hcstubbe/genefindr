Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone malignancies with a poor prognosis. 
In recent years, targeted therapy has shown great potential in the treatment of
osteosarcoma, and more effective therapeutic targets for this disease need to be 
developed. APLNR is a seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor expressed
widely in multiple tissues. As has been reported, APLNR is involved in various
physiological and pathological processes. Although APLNR plays a role in the
development and progression of multiple tumors, the potential role of APLNR in
osteosarcoma, a highly malignant tumor, remains unclear. Here, we reported that
APLNR expression was correlated positively with clinical features including tumor
size and stage of osteosarcoma. We found that APLNR knockdown inhibited the
proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. In addition, APLNR
could promote the progression and metastasis of osteosarcoma in mice.
Collectively, this study showed the potential link between APLNR and osteosarcoma
and suggested APLNR as a novel therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadliest primary adult brain tumor.
Invasion, resistance to therapy, and tumor recurrence in GBM can be attributed in
part to brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs). BTICs isolated from various
patient-derived xenografts showed high expression of the poorly characterized
Apelin early ligand A (APELA) gene. Although originally considered to be a
non-coding gene, the APELA gene encodes a protein that binds to the Apelin
receptor and promotes the growth of human embryonic stem cells and the formation 
of the embryonic vasculature. We found that both APELA mRNA and protein are
expressed at high levels in a subset of brain tumor patients, and that APELA is
also expressed in putative stem cell niche in GBM tumor tissue. Analysis of APELA
and the Apelin receptor gene expression in brain tumor datasets showed that high 
APELA expression was associated with poor patient survival in both glioma and
glioblastoma, and APELA expression correlated with glioma grade. In contrast,
gene expression of the Apelin receptor or Apelin was not found to be associated
with patient survival, or glioma grade. Consequently, APELA may play an important
role in glioblastoma tumorigenesis and may be a future therapeutic target.

The apelin receptor is a potential target in the treatment of heart failure and
pulmonary arterial hypertension where levels of endogenous apelin peptides are
reduced but significant receptor levels remain. Our aim was to characterise the
pharmacology of a modified peptide agonist, MM202, designed to have high affinity
for the apelin receptor and resistance to peptidase degradation and linked to an 
anti-serum albumin domain antibody (AlbudAb) to extend half-life in the blood. In
competition binding experiments in human heart MM202-AlbudAb (pKi =9.39±0.09)
bound with similar high affinity as the endogenous peptides [Pyr1 ]apelin-13 (pKi
=8.83±0.06) and apelin-17 (pKi =9.57±0.08). [Pyr1 ]apelin-13 was 10-fold more
potent in the cAMP (pD2 =9.52±0.05) compared to the β-arrestin (pD2 =8.53±0.03)
assay, whereas apelin-17 (pD2 =10.31±0.28; pD2 =10.15±0.13, respectively) and
MM202-AlbudAb (pD2 =9.15±0.12; pD2 =9.26±0.03, respectively) were equipotent in
both assays, with MM202-AlbudAb 10-fold less potent than apelin-17. MM202-AlbudAb
bound to immobilised human serum albumin with high affinity (pKD =9.02). In
anaesthetised, male Sprague-Dawley rats, MM202-AlbudAb (5nmol, n=15)
significantly reduced left ventricular systolic pressure by 6.61±1.46mmHg and
systolic arterial pressure by 14.12±3.35mmHg and significantly increased cardiac 
contractility by 533±170mmHg/s, cardiac output by 1277±190RVU/min, stroke volume 
by 3.09±0.47RVU and heart rate by 4.64±2.24BPM. This study demonstrates that
conjugating an apelin mimetic peptide to the AlbudAb structure retains receptor
and in vivo activity and may be a new strategy for development of apelin peptides
as therapeutic agents. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

CONTEXT: Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity
worldwide. Although there has been great progress in the understanding of
preeclampsia, the exact cause for the disease development is still unclear.
Recently, it showed that genetic deletion of ELABELA (ELA, also known as apela)
could induce preeclampsia-like symptoms in mouse. However, the role of ELA in the
disease development of preeclampsia remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: Measure the changes of ELA levels in maternal serum, urine and
placenta from preeclamptic pregnancy and healthy pregnancy and evaluate the
correlation between ELA level and the occurrence of preeclampsia. Meantime,
investigate the effect of ELA on the migration and proliferation of human
trophoblast cells.
RESULTS: ELA level is significantly decreased in late-onset preeclampsia
pregnancies compare to normal pregnancy. The mRNA and protein expression of ELA
and apelin receptor (APLNR, or APJ) in late-onset preeclampsia placental tissues 
are also decreased. Furthermore, our in vitro study showed that addition of ELA
significantly increased the invasion ability and proliferation of trophoblast
cells, which was inhibited by the APJ specific antagonist-ML221.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified ELA is significantly decreased in late-onset
preeclampsia and thus it might play an important role in the pathogenesis of
late-onset preeclampsia.

High mortality rates in ovarian cancer (OvCa) are due to late stage diagnosis
when extensive metastases are present, coupled with the eventual development of
resistance to standard chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to identify
targetable pathways to curtail this deadly disease. In this study we show that
apelin receptor APJ is a viable target that promotes tumor progression of
high-grade serous OvCa (HGSOC). APJ is specifically overexpressed in tumor
tissue, and is elevated in metastatic tissues compared to primary tumors.
Importantly, increased APJ expression significantly correlates with decreased
median overall survival by 14.7 months in HGSOC patients. Using various OvCa
model systems, we demonstrate that APJ expression in cancer cells is both
necessary and sufficient to increase pro-metastatic phenotypes in vitro,
including proliferation, cell adhesion to various molecules of the extracellular 
matrix, anoikis resistance, migration, and invasion; and these phenotypes are
efficiently inhibited by APJ inhibitor ML221. Overexpression of APJ also
increases metastasis of OvCa cells in vivo. Mechanistically, the pro-metastatic
STAT3 pathway is activated downstream of APJ, and in addition to the ERK and AKT 
pathways, contributes to its aggressive phenotypes. Our findings suggest that the
APJ pathway is a novel and viable target, with potential to curb OvCa progression
and metastasis. Implications: The APJ pathway is a viable target in high-grade
serous ovarian carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: The APLNR (apelin receptor) has been shown to be an essential gene
for cancer immunotherapy, with deficiency in APLNR leading to immunotherapy
failure. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of APLN (apelin) 
and APLNR in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and its association with
clinicopathological parameters and survival.
METHODS: Three well-characterised patient cohorts with RCC were used: Study
cohort 1 (clear-cell RCC; APLN/APLNR mRNA expression; n = 166); TCGA validation
cohort (clear-cell RCC; APLN/APLNR mRNA expression; n = 481); Study cohort 2 (all
RCC subtypes; APLNR protein expression/immunohistochemistry; n = 300).
Associations between mRNA/protein expression and clinicopathological
variables/patients' survival were tested statistically.
RESULTS: While APLN showed only very weak association with tumour histological
grade (TCGA cohort), APLNR/mRNA protein expression correlate significantly with
ccRCC aggressiveness. APLNR is expressed in tumour vasculature and tumour cells
at different levels, and these expression levels associate with tumour
aggressiveness in opposing directions. APLNR expression was negatively correlated
with PD-L1 expression by tumour cells in a subset of patients with ccRCC. APLNR
expression in either compartment is an independent prognostic factor for survival
of patients with ccRCC.
CONCLUSION: The APLNR/APLN-system appears to play an important role in ccRCC,
warranting further clinical investigation.

Cell migration is one of the major cellular processes in development, tissue
regeneration, wound healing, cancer and immune function. Underlying molecular
mechanism behind the fibroblast cell migration and matrix interactions generates 
the basis of tissue homeostasis. The role of Apelin receptor (Aplnr) signaling in
gastrulation movements has emerged in recent years but how Aplnr regulates cell
movement remains unclear. In the current study, the migratory activity of Aplnr
signaling has been shown in cultured fibroblast cells in vitro by scratch assay, 
gene and protein expression analyses. Aplnr signaling was activated and knocked
down in MEFs and NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast cells to analyze whether cell migration
is affected by Aplnr signalling. Activation of Aplnr signaling by Apelin peptide 
and small molecule ML-233 increased cell movement and expression of migration
related gene and proteins including Actin and Vimentin. Similarly, reducing the
expression of Aplnr and Apelin (Apln) by siRNA exposure inhibited cell migration 
of mouse fibroblast cells. Application of Apelin peptide and small molecule
ML-233 to human fibroblast cells enhanced scratch closure rate significantly
compared to control. This study demonstrated that activation of Aplnr signaling
promotes cell migration of fibroblast cells in vitro. Aplnr signaling could be a 
potential therapeutic candidate as a migration related regulatory mechanism in
cancer and wound healing for further research.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the human central and
peripheral nervous systems. n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22: 6n-3)
and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as well as apelin have anti-inflammatory effects 
in various cells. At the same time, apelin has anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic 
effects. The study was conducted to determine the effect of DHA on the
distribution of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) in the central nervous system in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model. DHA
treatment decreased the return time and total down time in the Parkinson group
which were measured by pole test. Besides, the ambulatory activity, distance and 
total locomotor activity were increased by DHA in the PD model of animals. The
time mice remained on the rotating rod mile was also significantly increased by
DHA treatment in MPTP injected animals. The apelin expression in the pons of mice
in the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were lower compared to the
Control group. When apelin and apelin receptor expressions in cerebrum were
examined, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups.
When apelin receptor expression in cerebellum was examined, the difference
between the Control and Parkinson + DHA, Parkinson and Parkinson + DHA, DHA and
Parkinson + DHA groups were statistically significant. Apelin receptor
expressions in pons of the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were lower
compared to the Control group. Apelin protein levels of cerebellum and pons were 
found to be decreased in DHA group compare with Control group. In conclusion; DHA
has been implicated in the expression of the apelin receptor and has reduced the 
expression of APJ receptor.

Anti-angiogenic therapy of glioblastoma with bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial 
growth factor-A (VEGFA)-blocking antibody, may accelerate tumor cell invasion and
induce alternative angiogenic pathways. Here we investigate the roles of the
pro-angiogenic receptor APLNR and its cognate ligand apelin in VEGFA/VEGFR2
anti-angiogenic therapy against distinct subtypes of glioblastoma. In proneural
glioblastoma, apelin levels were downregulated by VEGFA or VEGFR2 blockade. A
central role for apelin/APLNR in controlling glioblastoma vascularization was
corroborated in a serial implantation model of the angiogenic switch that occurs 
in human glioblastoma. Apelin and APLNR are broadly expressed in human
glioblastoma, and knockdown or knockout of APLN in orthotopic models of proneural
or classical glioblastoma subtypes significantly reduced glioblastoma
vascularization compared with controls. However, reduction in apelin expression
led to accelerated glioblastoma cell invasion. Analysis of stereotactic
glioblastoma biopsies from patients as well as from in vitro and in vivo
experiments revealed increased dissemination of APLNR-positive tumor cells when
apelin levels were reduced. Application of apelin-F13A, a mutant APLNR ligand,
blocked tumor angiogenesis and glioblastoma cell invasion. Furthermore,
co-targeting VEGFR2 and APLNR synergistically improved survival of mice bearing
proneural glioblastoma. In summary, we show that apelin/APLNR signaling controls 
glioblastoma angiogenesis and invasion and that both pathological features are
blunted by apelin-F13A. We suggest that apelin-F13A can improve the efficiency
and reduce the side effects of established anti-angiogenic treatments for
distinct glioblastoma subtypes.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Apelin is an endogenous vasodilatory and inotropic
peptide that is down-regulated in human pulmonary arterial hypertension, although
the density of the apelin receptor is not significantly attenuated. We
hypothesised that a G protein-biased apelin analogue MM07, which is more stable
than the endogenous apelin peptide, may be beneficial in this condition with the 
advantage of reduced β-arrestin-mediated receptor internalisation with chronic
use.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received either monocrotaline to 
induce pulmonary arterial hypertension or saline and then daily i.p. injections
of either MM07 or saline for 21 days. The extent of disease was assessed by right
ventricular catheterisation, cardiac MRI, and histological analysis of the
pulmonary vasculature. The effect of MM07 on signalling, proliferation, and
apoptosis of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells was investigated.
KEY RESULTS: MM07 significantly reduced the elevation of right ventricular
systolic pressure and hypertrophy induced by monocrotaline. Monocrotaline-induced
changes in cardiac structure and function, including right ventricular
end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, ejection fraction, and left ventricular
end-diastolic volume, were attenuated by MM07. MM07 also significantly reduced
monocrotaline-induced muscularisation of small pulmonary blood vessels. MM07
stimulated endothelial NOS phosphorylation and expression, promoted
proliferation, and attenuated apoptosis of human pulmonary arterial endothelial
cells in vitro.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that chronic treatment with
MM07 is beneficial in this animal model of pulmonary arterial hypertension by
addressing disease aetiology. These data support the development of G
protein-biased apelin receptor agonists with improved pharmacokinetic profiles
for use in human disease.

Apelins are human peptide hormones with various physiological activities,
including the moderation of cardiovascular, renal, metabolic and neurological
function. Their potency is dependent on and limited by proteolytic degradation in
the circulatory system. Here we identify human plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) as a
protease that cleaves the first three N-terminal amino acids (KFR) of apelin-17. 
The cleavage kinetics are similar to neprilysin (NEP), which cleaves within the
critical 'RPRL'-motif thereby inactivating apelin. The resulting C-terminal
14-mer after KLKB1 cleavage has much lower biological activity, and the presence 
of its N-terminal basic arginine seems to negate the blood pressure lowering
effect. Based on C-terminally engineered apelin analogs (A2), resistant to
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), attachment of an N-terminal C16 fatty
acid chain (PALMitoylation) or polyethylene glycol chain (PEGylation) minimizes

BACKGROUND: Disturbances in adipokine secretion are associated with the risk of
cancer growth and progression.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the mRNA expression and protein 
levels of apelin, the apelin receptor, resistin, and adiponectin in the tumor
tissues of surgically treated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients.
Concentrations of serum adipokines were assessed in relation to ESCC progression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 53 patients with ESCC and 27
controls. In the ESCC group, 27 patients were surgically treated and 26 were
treated with palliative procedures. RT-PCR and ELISA tests were used to measure
the mRNA expression and protein level of adipokines in tissues and their
concentration in serum.
RESULTS: We found that mRNA expression and protein concentrations of apelin, the 
apelin receptor and resistin were significantly higher in tumor tissue than in
control tissue. The protein concentration of apelin were significantly increased 
in the tumors of patients with lymph node metastasis (p < 0.005). Circulating
levels of apelin, the apelin receptor and resistin were significantly higher in
the cancer patients than in controls (p < 0.05 for all). The concentration of
serum apelin receptor significantly decreased in patients with stage IV cancer,
the presence of lymph node or distant metastasis (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Apelin may participate in lymphangiogenesis and the progression of
ESCC. The apelin receptor is intensely produced in the early stage of cancer
development and it may take part in the carcinogenic processes of ESCC.

Apelin receptor(s) (APLNR) are suggested to mediate the actions of apelin and
Elabela (ELA) peptides in many physiological processes, including cardiovascular 
development and food intake in vertebrates. However, the functionality of APLNR
has not been examined in most vertebrate groups. Here, we characterized two
APLNRs APLNR1, APLNR2) in chickens and red-eared sliders, and three APLNRs in
zebrafish (APLNR2a, APLNR2b, APLNR3a), which are homologous to human APLNR. Using
luciferase-reporter assays or Western blot, we demonstrated that in chickens,
APLNR1 (not APLNR2) expressed in HEK293 cells was potently activated by chicken
apelin-36 and ELA-32 and coupled to Gi-cAMP and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways,
indicating a crucial role of APLNR1 in mediating apelin/ELA actions; in red-eared
sliders, APLNR2 (not APLNR1) was potently activated by apelin-36/ELA-32,
suggesting that APLNR2 may mediate apelin/ELA actions; in zebrafish, both APLNR2a
and APLNR2b were potently activated by apelin-36/ELA-32 and coupled to Gi-cAMP
signaling pathway, as previously proposed, whereas the novel APLNR3a was
specifically and potently activated by apelin. Similarly, an apelin-specific
receptor (APLNR3b) sharing 57% sequence identity with zebrafish APLNR3a was
identified in Nile tilapia. Collectively, our data facilitates the uncovering of 
the roles of APLNR signaling in different vertebrate groups and suggests a key
functional switch between APLNR1 and APLNR2/3 in mediating the actions of ELA and
apelin during vertebrate evolution.

Objectives: Apelin/APJ system plays an important role in the regulation of
myocardial contractility (MC) and blood pressure. Opioid receptors (OPRs) are
also important cardiovascular regulators and exert many of their effects through 
modulating the function of other systems. This study analyzed the interaction
between APJ and kappa OPRs (KOR) in cardiac responsiveness to apelin in acute
reno-vascular hypertension (2K1C).
Materials and Methods: MC studies were carried out on 2K1C rats. F13A (APJ
blocker), Naloxone (OPR inhibitor), nor-Binaltorphiminedihydrochloride (nor-BNI; 
kappa OPR inhibitor), PTX (Gi path inhibitor) and chelerytrine (protein kinase C;
PKC inhibitor) were administered prior to apelin 20 and 40 μg/kg. The
phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) (PERK) was
also assessed. Dimerization of APJ and KOR was evaluated by immunoprecipitation.
Results: Both doses of apelin reduced blood pressure. Apelin 40 exerted a
negative inotropic effect, which was inhibited by nor-BNI, but apelin 20 showed a
positive inotropic effect, which was resistant to this inhibition. Hypertension
increased heterodimerization of the APJ and KOR and this was reduced by apelin
20. F13A, naloxone and PTX significantly reduced PERK in apelin 40 group, but
F13A, naloxone, and chelerytrine significantly increased PERK in the apelin 20
group.
Conclusion: The lowering effect of apelin 40 on MC and its non-effectiveness on
APJ/KOR dimerization, while augmenting the contractility and reducing the
dimerization by apelin 20 implies the APJ/KOR-related effects of apelin on the MC
under acute reno-vascular hypertension. This may have potential clinical
applications as apelin has been introduced as a potential therapeutic agent in
heart failure and opioids are being currently used in the treatment of myocardial
infarction.

Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific syndrome that is characterized by
hypertension and proteinuria. The etiology of PE is not completely understood but
is believed to involve placental insufficiency and maternal vascular damage.
Growing evidence supports an important role for the apelin receptor (APJ) system 
in regulating cardiovascular physiology. There are two vertebrate APJ ligands,
APELIN and ELABELA, both of which mediate vasodilatory functions. A recent study 
linked deficient ELABELA signaling and the development of PE, though the
molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the
biological function of the ELABELA and APJ system in cardiovascular homeostasis
and discuss the potential mechanisms by which ELABELA and APJ regulate placenta
trophoblast invasion and vascular functions and participate in the development of
PE.

Sheep are the most bred species in the Central Italy Apennine using the natural
pastures as a trophic resource and grazing activity is fundamental to maintain
the grassland biodiversity: this goal can be reached only ensuring an economical 
sustainability to the farmers. This study aimed to investigate the apelin/apelin 
receptor system in ovine mammary gland and to evaluate the differences induced by
food supplementation, in order to shed light on this system function. A flock of 
15 Comisana x Appenninica adult dry ewes were free to graze from June until
pasture maximum flowering (MxF). From this period to pasture maximum dryness
(MxD), in addition to grazing, the experimental group (Exp) was supplemented with
600 g/day/head of cereals. Apelin and apelin receptor were assessed by Real-Time 
PCR and immunohistochemistry on the mammary glands of subjects pertaining to MxF,
MxD and Exp groups. They were detected in alveolar and ductal epithelial cells.
The pasture maximum flowering group showed significant differences in apelin
expression compared with experimental and MxD groups. Apelin receptor expression 
significantly differed among the three groups. The reduced apelin receptor
expression and immunoreactivity levels during parenchyma involution enables us to
hypothesize that apelin receptor plays a modulating role in the system control.

Dysfunction of the apelinergic system, comprised of the neuropeptide apelin
mediating its effects via the G protein-coupled apelin receptor (APJ), may
underlie the onset of cardiovascular disease such as hypertension. Apelin
expression is increased in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) compared to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)
normotensive rats, however, evidence that the apelinergic system chronically
influences mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) under pathophysiological
conditions remains to be established. In this study we investigated, in conscious
unrestrained rats, whether APJ contributes to MABP and sympathetic vasomotor tone
in the progression of two models of hypertension - SHR and L-NAME-treated rats - 
and whether APJ contributes to the development of hypertension in
pre-hypertensive SHR. In SHR we showed that APJ gene (aplnr) expression was
elevated in the RVLM, and there was a greater MABP increase following
microinjection of [Pyr1]apelin-13 to the RVLM of SHR compared to WKY rats.
Bilateral microinjection of a lentiviral APJ-specific-shRNA construct into the
RVLM of WKY, SHR, and L-NAME-treated rats, chronically implanted with
radiotelemeters to measure MABP, decreased aplnr expression in the RVLM and
abolished acute [Pyr1]apelin-13-induced increases in MABP. However, chronic
knockdown of aplnr in the RVLM did not affect MABP in either SHR or
L-NAME-treated rats. Moreover, knockdown of aplnr in the RVLM of prehypertensive 
SHR did not protect against the development of hypertension. These results show
that endogenous apelin, acting via APJ, is not involved in the genesis or
maintenance of hypertension in either animal model used in this study.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: This aim of this study was to better understand
ulcerative interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) at the
molecular level and provide new clues related to diagnosis and treatment.
METHODS: The microarray data set GSE11783, including the mRNA and miRNA profiles 
of bladder tissue obtained at cystoscopic biopsy from patients with ulcerative
IC/PBS (presence of at least one Hunner's ulcer) and normal controls, was
downloaded from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database (National Center for
Biotechnology Information). These were evaluated using Greenspring GX and
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. The differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) in these two groups were identified. Subsequently, the
DEGs were subjected to functional analysis, and a protein-protein interaction
(PPI) network was constructed. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was
visualized using Cystoscope software.
RESULTS: Four DEMs and 1521 DEGs were identified between the ulcerative IC/PBS
and control groups. The PPI network of the DEGs was constructed by STRING, which 
was composed of 393 nodes and 1039 edges, including 221 upregulated genes and 172
downregulated genes. Moreover, 27 genes in the PPI network were identified as hub
genes in the IC/PBS group, e.g., PNOC, SSTR1, FPR3, GPR18 and APLNR.
Subsequently, 27 clusters were selected from the PPI network using MCODE. It was 
shown that the most significant cluster consisted of 22 nodes and 231 edges.
Moreover, miR-21 was the most significantly upregulated miRNA and was predicted
to target one upregulated gene (RASGRP1) and two downregulated genes (KLF5 and
SC5D).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this data mining and integration provide further
information on the possible molecular basis of IC/PBS pathogenesis as well as
potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ulcerative IC/PBS diagnosis and 
treatment.

Apelin is a peptide hormone that binds to a class A GPCR (the apelin
receptor/APJ) to regulate various bodily systems. Upon signal peptide removal,
the resulting 55-residue isoform, proapelin/apelin-55, can be further processed
to 36-, 17-, or 13-residue isoforms with length-dependent pharmacological
properties. Processing was initially proposed to occur intracellularly. However, 
detection of apelin-55 in extracellular fluids indicates that extracellular
processing may also occur. To test for this, apelin-55 was applied exogenously to
HEK293A cells overexpressing proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 3 (PCSK3),
the only apelin processing enzyme identified thus far, and to differentiated
3T3-L1 adipocytes, which endogenously express apelin, PCSK3 and other proprotein 
convertases. Analysis of culture media constituents from each cell type by high
performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and western blot demonstrated
a time-dependent decrease in apelin-55 levels. This decrease was partially, but
not fully, attenuated by PCSK inhibitor treatment in both cell lines. Comparison 
of the resulting apelin-55-derived peptide profile between the two cell lines
demonstrated distinct processing patterns, with apelin-36 production apparent in 
3T3-L1 adipocytes vs. detection of the prodomain of a shorter isoform (likely the
apelin-13 prodomain, observed after additional proteolytic processing) in
PCSK3-transfected HEK293A cells. Extracellular processing of apelin, with
distinct cell type dependence, provides an alternative mechanism to regulate
isoform-mediated physiological effects of apelin.

Biased ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) may have improved
therapeutic benefits and safety profiles. However, the molecular mechanism of
GPCR biased signaling remains largely unknown. Using apelin receptor (APJ) as a
model, we systematically investigated the potential effects of amino acid
residues around the orthosteric binding site on biased signaling. We discovered
that a single residue mutation I109A (I1093.32) in the transmembrane domain 3
(TM3) located in the deep ligand-binding pocket was sufficient to convert a
balanced APJ into a G protein signaling biased receptor. APJ I109A mutant
receptor retained full capabilities in ligand binding and G protein activation,
but was defective in GRK recruitment, β-arrestin recruitment, and downstream
receptor-mediated ERK activation. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, we
proposed a molecular mechanism for biased signaling of I109A mutant receptor. We 
postulate that due to the extra space created by I109A mutation, the phenyl group
of the last residue (Phe-13) of apelin rotates down and initiates a cascade of
conformational changes in TM3. Phe-13 formed a new cluster of hydrophobic
interactions with the sidechains of residues in TM3, including F1103.33 and
M1133.36, which stabilizes the mutant receptor in a conformation favoring biased 
signaling. Interruption of these stabilizing interactions by double mutation
F110A/I109A or M113A/I109A largely restored the β-arrestin-mediated signaling.
Taken together, we describe herein the discovery of a biased APJ mutant receptor 
and provide detailed molecular insights into APJ signaling selectivity,
facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutics targeting APJ.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are essential for stress adaptation, acting centrally and
in the periphery. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a major regulator of
adrenal GC synthesis, is produced in the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus (PVH), which contains multiple neuroendocrine and preautonomic
neurons. GCs may be involved in diverse regulatory mechanisms in the PVH, but the
target genes of GCs are largely unexplored except for the CRF gene (Crh), a
well-known target for GC negative feedback. Using a genome-wide RNA-sequencing
analysis, we identified transcripts that changed in response to either high-dose 
corticosterone (Cort) exposure for 12 days (12-day high Cort), corticoid
deprivation for 7 days (7-day ADX), or acute Cort administration. Among others,
canonical GC target genes were upregulated prominently by 12-day high Cort. Crh
was upregulated or downregulated most prominently by either 7-day ADX or 12-day
high Cort, emphasizing the recognized feedback effects of GC on the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Concomitant changes in vasopressin and
apelin receptor gene expression are likely to contribute to HPA repression. In
keeping with the pleotropic cellular actions of GCs, 7-day ADX downregulated
numerous genes of a broad functional spectrum. The transcriptome response
signature differed markedly between acute Cort injection and 12-day high Cort.
Remarkably, six immediate early genes were upregulated 1 hour after Cort
injection, which was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and
semiquantitative in situ hybridization. This study may provide a useful database 
for studying the regulatory mechanisms of GC-dependent gene expression and
repression in the PVH.

Inflammasomes activate caspase-1 in response to molecular signals from pathogens 
and other dangerous stimuli as a part of the innate immune response. A previous
study discovered a small-molecule, 4-fluoro-
N'-[1-(2-pyridinyl)ethylidene]benzohydrazide, which we named DN1, that reduces
the cytotoxicity of anthrax lethal toxin (LT). We determined that DN1 protected
cells irrespectively of LT concentration and reduced the pathogenicity of an
additional bacterial exotoxin and several viruses. Using the LT cytotoxicity
pathway, we show that DN1 does not prevent LT internalization and catalytic
activity or caspase-1 activation. Moreover, DN1 does not affect the proteolytic
activity of host cathepsin B, which facilitates the cytoplasmic entry of toxins. 
PubChem Bioactivities lists two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), type-1
angiotensin II receptor and apelin receptor, as targets of DN1. The inhibition of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C, and protein kinase B, which are
downstream of GPCR signaling, synergized with DN1 in protecting cells from LT. We
hypothesize that DN1-mediated antagonism of GPCRs modulates signal transduction
pathways to induce a cellular state that reduces LT-induced pyroptosis downstream
of caspase-1 activation. DN1 also reduced the susceptibility of Drosophila
melanogaster to toxin-associated bacterial infections. Future experiments will
aim to further characterize how DN1 modulates signal transduction pathways to
inhibit pyroptotic cell death in LT-sensitive macrophages. DN1 represents a novel
chemical probe to investigate host cellular mechanisms that mediate cell death in
response to pathogenic agents.

Objective: The mechanisms that lead to endothelial cell (EC) injury and propagate
the vasculopathy in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) are not well understood. Using
single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and
signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. Methods: We
implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated
from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway
analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using
immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and
healthy skin. Results: By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of
known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells.
Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs
from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the 
SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with 
extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed
genes, HSPG2 and APLNR, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry
staining and real-time qPCR analysis. Conclusion: ScRNA-seq, differential gene
expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a
discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and
activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of
angiogenesis. HSPG2 and APLNR were identified as two of the top markers of EC
injury in SSc.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a common cause of maternal morbidity, characterized by
impaired trophoblast invasion and spiral artery transformation resulting in
progressive uteroplacental hypoxia. Given the primary role of LIN28A and LIN28B
in modulating cell metabolism, differentiation, and invasion, we hypothesized
that LIN28A and/or LIN28B regulates trophoblast differentiation and invasion, and
that its dysregulation may contribute to PE. Here we show that LIN28B is
expressed ∼1300-fold higher than LIN28A in human term placenta and is the
predominant paralog expressed in primary human trophoblast cultures. The
expression of LIN28B mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in
gestational age-matched preeclamptic vs. normal placentas, whereas LIN28A
expression is not different. First trimester human placental sections displayed
stronger LIN28B immunoreactivity in extravillous (invasive) cytotrophoblasts and 
syncytial sprouts vs. villous trophoblasts. LIN28B overexpression increased HTR8 
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas LIN28B knockdown in JEG3
cells reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, LIN28B knockdown in JEG3 cells
suppressed syncytin 1 (SYN-1), apelin receptor early endogenous ligand (ELABELA),
and the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster, and increased mRNA expression of ITGβ4
and TNF-α. Incubation of BeWo and JEG3 cells under hypoxia significantly
decreased expression of LIN28B and LIN28A, SYN-1, and ELABELA, whereas TNF-α is
increased. These results provide the first evidence that LIN28B is the
predominant paralog in human placenta and that decreased LIN28B may play a role
in PE by reducing trophoblast invasion and syncytialization, and by promoting
inflammation.-Canfield, J., Arlier, S., Mong, E. F., Lockhart, J., VanWye, J.,

Exposure to stress induces gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility. In rodents, acute
restraint stress (ARS) inhibits gastric emptying (GE) and intestinal transit (IT)
via central and peripheral corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-mediated
pathways. Peripherally administered apelin-13 was shown to inhibit GI motor
functions; moreover, stress-induced upregulation of gastric apelin content was
demonstrated in rats suggesting that peripheral apelin may mediate stress-induced
alterations in GI motility. We investigated the role of endogenous peripheral
apelin in stress-induced GI dysfunction. GE, IT and gastro-duodenal fasting
motility were measured in non-stressed (NS), CRF-injected and ARS-loaded rats.
CRF and apelin receptor antagonists astressin or F13A was administered before ARS
or peripheral CRF injection. Apelin and APJ receptor expressions were determined 
using immunohistochemistry and quantified by qRT-PCR. Double immunofluorescence
was performed for enteric neuronal apelin. GE and IT were delayed by CRF and ARS.
ARS-induced changes were attenuated by F13A, whereas astressin was ineffective.
CRF-induced alterations in GE and IT were restored completely by astressin, while
they were diminished by F13A. Antral phase III-like contractions were disturbed
following ARS which were preserved by preadministration of astressin, but not
F13A. CRF impaired gastric and duodenal fasting contractions, while these changes
were not altered by F13A. ARS increased apelin expression in stomach and
duodenum. Apelin immunoreactivity was detected in mucosa, smooth muscles and
myenteric plexi, whereas dense APJ receptor expression was observed within tunica
muscularis. APJ receptor was downregulated in rats fasted overnight. These
results suggest that enteric apelin acts as an inhibitor stress mediator in the
postprandial state.

Colon cancer is one of the most common cancer types. Its positive correlation
with general obesity has led to increasing amounts of research focusing on the
role of adipokines in colon cancer development. Apelin is a peptide released by
adipose tissue that could affect many cellular processes connected with
carcinogenesis. In this study, we examined the role of apelin in the motility
regulation of colon cancer cells. We showed that the effect of four different
apelin peptides increased the ability of cancer cells to migrate and invade
examined cells trough influencing migratory protrusions formation and actin
cytoskeleton rearrangement. Additionally, using confocal microscopy, we noticed
that apelin stimulated the proteolytic activity of cancer cells, especially
increasing the level of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloprotease. Taken together,
apelin increased the movement of colon cancer cells through several possible
mechanisms. Moreover, better understanding the process through which apelin
regulates cancer development is still necessary to the creation of novel
anti-cancer therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of bromodomain and extra terminal (BET)
bromodomain in hematopoietic differentiation from human enbryonic stem cells
(hESC).
METHODS: The effect of BET hematopoietic inhibitor I-BET151 on hematopoietic
differentiation from hESC was detected by using a monolayer hematopoietic
defferentiation model, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and real-time PCR;
moreover the role of I-BET151 in process of hematopoietic differentiation was
explored by adding I-BET151 in different differentiation stages.
RESULTS: The analysis results of immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and real-time
PCR showed that I-BET 151 significantly inhibited the generation of CD43 positive
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). It was found that the addition
of I-BET 151 in different stages, including APLNR+ lateral plate mesoderm
production, CD34+CD31+ hemogenic endothelium (HEP) generation and
endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, significantly suppressed the generation 
of CD43 positive hematopoietic progenitor cells.
CONCLUSION: I-BET 151 inhibites hematopoietic differentiation from hESCs at
several stages, suggesting that the BET bromodomain plays important roles in
multiple stages of hematopoietic differentiation from hESCs.

Apelin peptides are cognate ligands for the apelin receptor, a G-protein-coupled 
receptor (GPCR). The apelinergic system plays critical roles in wide-ranging
physiological activities including function and development of the central
nervous and cardiovascular systems. Apelin is found in 13-55 residue isoforms in 
vivo, all of which share the C-terminal portion of the preproapelin precursor.
Characterization of high-resolution structures and detergent micelle interactions
of apelin-17 led to a two-step membrane-catalyzed binding and GPCR activation
mechanism hypothesis recapitulated in longer isoforms. Here, we examine
interactions of the apelin-13 and -17 isoforms with isotropic zwitterionic and
mixed zwitterionic-anionic lipid bicelles to test for hallmarks of membrane
catalysis in a more physiological membrane-mimetic environment than a micelle.
Specifically, 1H and 31P relaxation and diffusion solution-state NMR techniques
demonstrate that both apelin isoforms interact with both types of isotropic
bicelles. Bicelle hydrodynamics were observed to be differentially modulated by
apelin peptides, although these effects were minimal. Phospholipid headgroup 31P 
spin relaxation behaviour was, conversely, clearly perturbed. Perturbation of
this nature was also observed in magnetically aligned bicelles by 31P solid-state
NMR spectroscopy and spin relaxation experiments. This behaviour is consistent
with an apelin-bicelle binding process allowing significant peptide mobility,
facilitating membrane-catalyzed GPCR encounter.

Sarcopenia, the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality and strength, 
lacks early diagnostic tools and new therapeutic strategies to prevent the
frailty-to-disability transition often responsible for the medical
institutionalization of elderly individuals. Herein we report that production of 
the endogenous peptide apelin, induced by muscle contraction, is reduced in an
age-dependent manner in humans and rodents and is positively associated with the 
beneficial effects of exercise in older persons. Mice deficient in either apelin 
or its receptor (APLNR) presented dramatic alterations in muscle function with
increasing age. Various strategies that restored apelin signaling during aging
further demonstrated that this peptide considerably enhanced muscle function by
triggering mitochondriogenesis, autophagy and anti-inflammatory pathways in
myofibers as well as enhancing the regenerative capacity by targeting muscle stem
cells. Taken together, these findings revealed positive regulatory feedback
between physical activity, apelin and muscle function and identified apelin both 
as a tool for diagnosis of early sarcopenia and as the target of an innovative
pharmacological strategy to prevent age-associated muscle weakness and restore
physical autonomy.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Elabela (ELA) or Toddler is a recently identified hormone that
plays a crucial role in embryonic development through the activation of the
apelin receptor (APJ). Our previous study indicated that ELA is highly expressed 
in adult kidney and the ELA receptor signaling pathway is functional in mammalian
systems. Whereas nothing is yet known regarding ELA and diabetic kidney disease
(DKD). Here, we evaluated the relationship between serum ELA levels and
albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: An observational study involving 80 patients divided into groups
according to their baseline urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR): Group 1 (ACR 
≤ 29 mg/g), Group 2 (ACR = 30-299 mg/g), Group 3 (ACR ≥ 300 mg/g with normal
serum creatinine), and Group 4 (ACR ≥ 300 mg/g with increased serum creatinine). 
The demographic, clinical, and biochemical variables including serum ELA were
obtained or measured through disease history, physical examination, or laboratory
evidence.
RESULTS: The results showed that the serum ELA levels decreased gradually with
the deterioration of DKD from the stages of normal albuminuria, microalbuminuria,
macroalbuminuria, to macroalbuminuria and elevated serum creatinine. In addition,
ELA had a significantly negative correlation with ACR (r = -0.561, P < 0.001),
retinopathy (r = -0.424, P < 0.001), serum creatinine (r = -0.269, P = 0.016),
SBP (r = -0.249, P = 0.026), DBP (r = -0.261, P = 0.020) and a positive
correlation with eGFR (r = 0.318, P = 0.004). Furthermore, stepwise multiple
linear regression analysis showed that ACR, retinopathy, and LDL-C were
considered the most relevant variables to ELA, and ELA, retinopathy, eGFR, and
age were important predictors for ACR (t = -4.546, P = 0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the clinical
relationship between ELA levels and CKD. Decreased serum ELA levels might be a
significant clinical predictor in patients with DKD or even as a promising agent 
for treating CKD patients.

Mesenchymoangioblast (MB) is the earliest precursor for endothelial and
mesenchymal cells originating from APLNR+PDGFRα+KDR+ mesoderm in human
pluripotent stem cell cultures. MBs are identified based on their capacity to
form FGF2-dependent compact spheroid colonies in a serum-free semisolid medium.
MBs colonies are composed of PDGFRβ+CD271+EMCN+DLK1+CD73- primitive mesenchymal
cells which are generated through endothelial/angioblastic intermediates (cores) 
formed during first 3-4 days of clonogenic cultures. MB-derived primitive
mesenchymal cells have potential to differentiate into mesenchymal stromal/stem
cells (MSCs), pericytes, and smooth muscle cells. In this review, we summarize
the specification and developmental potential of MBs, emphasize features that
distinguish MBs from other mesenchymal progenitors described in the literature
and discuss the value of these findings for identifying molecular pathways
leading to MSC and vasculogenic cell specification, and developing cellular
therapies using MB-derived progeny.

RATIONALE: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells
(iPSC-ECs) have risen as a useful tool in cardiovascular research, offering a
wide gamut of translational and clinical applications. However, inefficiency of
the currently available iPSC-EC differentiation protocol and underlying
heterogeneity of derived iPSC-ECs remain as major limitations of iPSC-EC
technology.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we performed droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) of the human iPSCs after iPSC-EC differentiation. Droplet-based
scRNA-seq enables analysis of thousands of cells in parallel, allowing
comprehensive analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Bona fide iPSC-EC cluster was identified by scRNA-seq, which
expressed high levels of endothelial-specific genes. iPSC-ECs, sorted by CD144
antibody-conjugated magnetic sorting, exhibited standard endothelial morphology
and function including tube formation, response to inflammatory signals, and
production of NO. Nonendothelial cell populations resulting from the
differentiation protocol were identified, which included immature cardiomyocytes,
hepatic-like cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, scRNA-seq
analysis of purified iPSC-ECs revealed transcriptional heterogeneity with 4 major
subpopulations, marked by robust enrichment of CLDN5, APLNR, GJA5, and ESM1
genes, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Massively parallel, droplet-based scRNA-seq allowed meticulous
analysis of thousands of human iPSCs subjected to iPSC-EC differentiation.
Results showed inefficiency of the differentiation technique, which can be
improved with further studies based on identification of molecular signatures
that inhibit expansion of nonendothelial cell types. Subtypes of bona fide human 
iPSC-ECs were also identified, allowing us to sort for iPSC-ECs with specific
biological function and identity.

Gastric vagal afferents play an important role in the peripheral control of food 
intake. Apelin, a central appetite regulating hormone, is also abundantly
released from the stomach. Whether apelin modulates gastric vagal afferent
signalling is unknown. We aimed to determine whether apelin modulates gastric
vagal afferent signalling under different states of nutrition. Female C57BL/6
mice were fed either a standard laboratory diet (SLD) or a high fat diet (HFD)
for 12 weeks. An in vitro gastric vagal afferent preparation was used to
determine the effect of apelin on gastric vagal afferent mechanosensitivity in
SLD mice, fed ad libitum or fasted overnight, and HFD mice. To determine the
signalling pathway of apelin via gastric vagal afferents, we determined the
expression of apelin receptor (APJ receptor) in the gastric mucosa, the whole
nodose ganglion and in gastric vagal afferent neurons innervating the stomach
using retrograde tracing and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The location of apelin and APJ receptor
within the gastric mucosa was determined by immunohistochemistry. Expression of
apelin and APJ receptor mRNA in gastric mucosa was determined using qRT-PCR.
Apelin inhibited the response of gastric mucosal vagal afferents to mucosal
stroking in fasted SLD mice, but not in mice fed ad libitum a SLD or HFD. Apelin 
inhibited the response of gastric tension sensitive afferents to circular stretch
in SLD mice fed ad libitum or fasted, an effect not observed in HFD mice. APJ
receptor mRNA was detected in the gastric mucosa and whole nodose ganglion, but
not specifically in gastric vagal afferents neurons. In the gastric mucosa, APJ
receptor immunoreactive cells were co-localised or closely associated with apelin
containing cells and co-localised with serotonin, gastrin, histamine and gastric 
intrinsic factor containing cells. In conclusion, apelin modulates gastric vagal 
afferent signalling in a nutritional status dependent manner. Further, apelin
modulates gastric vagal afferents through an indirect pathway, possibly through
the release of hormones/peptides from the gastric mucosa.

Apela identified from zebrafish Danio rerio for the first time in 2013 is a novel
endogenous peptide ligand for the apelin receptor. To study the role of apela in 
regulating fish feeding, the complementary (c) DNA sequence of apela of Siberian 
sturgeon Acipenser baerii was cloned for the first time. The apela cDNA fragment 
of 836 bp was obtained by cloning. The open reading frame (ORF) of apela was
165 bp encoding a 54 amino acid, including 22 amino acids signal peptide and two 
proteolytic sites. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that A. baerii apela was
clustered with mammalian and amphibian sequences. A. baerii apela messeger (m)RNA
was widely distributed in 11 tissues related to feeding, with high expressions in
brain, oesophagus and stomach, especially in the brain. The level of apela mRNA
in brain increased significantly after feeding. On the first day of fasting,
apela expression in brain was significantly lower than that of the fed group, but
after fasting for 3-15 days, the expression of apela in A. baerii brain was
significantly higher than that in the fed group. After refeeding apela mRNA
expression was obviously reduced. These results suggest that apela plays a
bidirectional role in feeding regulation of A. baerii, which may serve as a
short-term satiation factor and a long-term hunger factor.

Objectives: Considering the lack of information, the effects of mild endurance
exercise plus blood flow restriction (BFR) on electrocardiographic parameters,
hypertrophy index, and expression of angiotensin II receptors type 1 (AT1R) and
type 2 (AT2R) and apelin receptor (APJ) were assessed in hearts of old male rats.
Materials and Methods: Animal were grouped as control (CTL), Sham (Sh), lower
extremities blood flow restriction (BFR), exercise (Ex), Sham + exercise (Sh +
Ex), and blood flow restriction + exercise (BFR + Ex).
Results: Exercise plus BFR significantly decreased the corrected QT (QTc)
interval (P<0.01 vs CTL and Sh groups) and increased the heart hypertrophy index 
(P<0.05 vs CTL and BFR groups). Exercise alone increased expression of the APJ
(P<0.01, vs CTL, Sh, and BFR groups) and AT2 receptors (P<0.001, vs Sh, CTL, BFR,
and BFR + exercise groups), whereas it reduced expression of AT1R (P<0.01 in
comparison with CTL, Sh, and BFR groups). Exercise plus BFR caused a significant 
increase in APJ (P<0.05 vs Ex, Sh+Ex and P<0.001 vs CTL, Sh, and BFR groups) and 
also expression of AT1R (P<0.001 vs Ex, Sh + Ex, CTL, Sh, and P<0.01 vs BFR
groups). Accompaniment of exercise with BFR destroyed the effect of exercise on
the expression of AT2R.
Conclusion: Mild endurance exercise plus BFR can alter the expression of
angiotensin II and apelin receptors that leads to cardiac hypertrophy and
improves the ventricular conductivity of aging rats.

Since 2010, Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor has been restricted and
replaced by analogues like Bisphenol S (BPS). However, little is known about BPS 
effects and growing concern have suspected the "BPA-free" Label. Several recent
studies suggest that BPS is associated with increased risk of diabetes and
obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unidentified. The current
study investigates investigate BPS effects on hypothalamic neuropeptides
regulating feeding behavior, either orexigenic or anorexigenic in Swiss Albino
mice. We also studied the effect of BPS on the apelinergic system (apelin/apelin 
receptor (APJ)) as an original physiological system with pleiotropic actions.
Bisphenol S at 25, 50, 100 µg/kg was administered to mice in water drink for 10
weeks started after weaning. Our results showed that BPS exposure alters
orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptide (AgRP) regulating feeding behavior but not
anorexigenic neuropeptides (POMC, CART). Such orexigenic alterations may underlay
appetite disorders leading to a concomitant food intake and body weight gain
increase. In addition, data show that BPS affects the hypothalamic apelinergic
system. We found a significant decrease in APJ mRNA but not in apelin expression.
Based on hypothalamic APJ distribution, we suggested a potent specific
physiological alteration of this receptor in mediating neuroendocrine responses
in hypothalamus. Thus, our findings provide that BPS exposure could contribute to
the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.

AIMS: Apelin and leptin are factors which have a potential physiological and
pathological role in cardiovascular homoeostasis. Apelin receptor (APLNR), leptin
receptor (LEPR) and leptin variants may affect the vascular tone in heart or
peripheral circulation, thereby predisposing patients to hypertension and
coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate four 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of APLNR genes (rs11544374 and rs948847), 
LEPR (rs1137101) and leptin (rs7799039) gene in patients with CAD and
hypertension.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study was carried out on 286
CAD-suspected patients. The participants were divided into four subgroups
including: CAD patients with no hypertension (H-CAD+), hypertensive patients with
no CAD (H+CAD-), CAD patients with hypertension (H+CAD+) and non-hypertensive
non-CAD subjects as control group (H-CAD-). Genomic DNA from whole blood was
extracted and four SNPs were assessed using PCR-RFLP.
KEY FINDINGS: A significant difference was found in the genotype frequency of
APLNR rs11544374 gene in H+CAD+ and H-CAD+ groups compared to control subjects
(P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Regarding the rs1137101, the prevalence of A
allele compared to G allele was significantly different among the four groups
(P = 0.02). Results of multinomial regression analysis indicated that G allele
carriers in the recessive genetic model (AA vs. AG + GG) of rs11544374 had a
significantly protective effect compared to H-CAD+ and H+CAD+after adjustment
(OR = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.02-0.61; P = 0.01 and OR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.17-0.98;
P = 0.04, respectively).
SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of present study revealed that the APLNR rs11544374
gene polymorphism might serve as predisposing factor in CAD.

Apelin is an endogenous peptide identified as a ligand of the G protein-coupled
receptor APJ. Apelin belongs to the family of adipokines, which are bioactive
mediators released by adipose tissue. Extensive tissue distribution of apelin and
its receptor suggests, that it could be involved in many physiological processes 
including regulation of blood pressure, body fluid homeostasis, endocrine stress 
response, cardiac contractility, angiogenesis, and energy metabolism.
Additionally, this peptide participates in pathological processes, such as heart 
failure, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. In this article, we review current
knowledge about the role of apelin in organ and tissue pathologies. We also
summarize the mechanisms by which apelin and its receptor mediate the regulation 
of physiological and pathological processes. Moreover, we put forward an
indication of apelin as a biomarker predicting cardiac diseases and various types
of cancer. A better understanding of the function of apelin and its receptor in
pathologies might lead to the development of new medical compounds.

Objective: L-carnitine (LC) has been shown to protect cardiac metabolism in
diabetes patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Apelin, a newly discovered
adipocytokines, is an important regulator of cardiac muscle function; however,
the role of the level of expression of Apelin axis in improvement of cardiac
function by LC in diabetic patients, is not clear. In the present study, obese
insulin-resistant rats were used to determine the effect of LC, when given orally
with a high-calorie diet, on Apelin and Apelin receptor (Apj) expression in
cardiac muscle.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, rats were fed with
high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet for five weeks and subsequently were injected
with streptozotocin 30 mg/kg for induction of obesity and insulin resistance.
After confirming the induction of diabetes (serum glucose above 7.5 mmol/L), the 
animals received LC 300 mg/kg in drinking water for 28 days. On days 0, 14 and 28
after treatment, cardiac Apelin and Apj gene expression was evaluated by real
time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Serum levels of insulin, Apelin,
glucose, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and the
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were also measured
using commercial kits.
Results: Cardiac Apelin and Apj expression and serum Apelin were increased in
obese rats, while LC supplementation decreased the serum levels of Apelin and
down-regulated Apelin and Apj expression in cardiac muscle. These changes were
associated with reduced insulin resistance markers and serum inflammatory factors
and improved lipid profile.
Conclusion: We concluded that LC supplementation could attenuate the
over-expression of Apelin axis in heart of diabetic rats, a novel mechanism by
which LC improves cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.

The genetic deletion of apelin receptor early endogenous ligand (Elabela;
official name APELA) produces a preeclampsia-like phenotype in mice. However,
evidence linking ELABELA with human disease is lacking. Therefore, we measured
placental mRNA and circulating ELABELA in human samples. ELABELA mRNA (measured
by RNA sequencing) was unchanged in 82 preeclamptic placentas compared with 82
matched controls (mean difference, 0.53%; 95% CI, -25.9 to 27.0; P = 0.78). We
measured circulating ELABELA in 32 women with preterm preeclampsia (delivered at 
<34 weeks' gestation) and 32 matched controls sampled at the same gestational
age. There was no difference in circulating ELABELA concentrations in the
preeclamptic cohort compared with controls (median, 28.5 pg/mL; 95% CI, 5.3 to
63.2 versus median, 20.5 pg/mL; 95% CI, 9.2 to 58.0, respectively); the median
difference was 8.0 pg/mL (95% CI, -17.7 to 12.1; P = 0.43). In contrast, soluble 
FLT1 (a protein with an established association with preeclampsia) mRNA was
increased in placental tissue (mean difference, 34.9%; 95% CI, 16.6 to 53.1;
P = 0.001), and circulating concentrations were 16.8-fold higher among the
preeclamptic cohort (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, we were able to recapitulate the
association between circulating soluble FLT1 and preeclampsia, but there was no
association with ELABELA. The speculated clinical relevance of observations in
the murine model linking ELABELA to preeclampsia likely are incorrect.

G protein-coupled receptor 25 (GPR25) is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor in 
vertebrates, that has been implicated to be associated with autoimmune diseases
and regulate blood pressure in humans. However, the endogenous ligand of GPR25
remains unknown in vertebrates. Here, we reported that in non-mammalian
vertebrates (zebrafish, spotted gars, and pigeons), GPR25 could be activated by
Apelin and Apela peptides, which are also the two endogenous ligands of
vertebrate Apelin receptor (APLNR). Using the pGL3-CRE-luciferase reporter assay 
and confocal microscopy, we first demonstrated that like APLNR, zebrafish GPR25
expressing in HEK293 cells could be effectively activated by zebrafish Apelin and
Apela peptides, leading to the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production
and receptor internalization. Like zebrafish GPR25, pigeon and spotted gar GPR25 
could also be activated by Apelin and Apela, and their activation could inhibit
forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Interestingly, unlike zebrafish (/spotted
gar/pigeon) GPR25, human GPR25 could not be activated by Apelin and Apela under
the same experimental conditions. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that GPR25 is
expressed in a variety of tissues, including the testes and intestine of
zebrafish/spotted gars/humans, implying the potential roles of GPR25 signaling in
many physiological processes in vertebrates. Taken together, our data not only
provides the first proof that the orphan receptor GPR25 possesses two potential
ligands 'Apelin and Apela' and its activation decreases intracellular cAMP levels
in non-mammalian vertebrates, but also facilitates to unravel the physiological
roles of GPR25 signaling in vertebrates.

AIM: To investigate the possible role of ELABELA (ELA) in the histopathological
grading of gliomas.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed pathological specimens of
patients who underwent surgery for intracranial space-occupying lesions. Only
primary glioma specimens were included in this study. We enrolled 11 patients
histologically diagnosed with low-grade glioma and 22 patients with high-grade
glioma. The ELA antibody was applied to 4?6-?m-thick sections obtained from
paraffin blocks. Histoscores were calculated using the distribution and intensity
of staining immunoreactivity. An independent sample t-test was used for two-point
inter-group assessments, whereas one-way analysis of variance was used for the
other assessments. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The histoscores of the control brain, low-grade glioma, and high-grade
glioma tissues were found to be 0.08, 0.37, and 0.92, respectively. The
difference in ELA immunoreactivity between the control brain tissue and glioma
tissue was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In addition, a statistically
significant increase was observed in ELA immunoreactivity in high-grade glioma
tissues compared with that in low-grade glioma tissues (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: ELA has an angiogenetic role in the progression of glial tumors. ELA,
which is an endogenous ligand of the apelin receptor, activates the apelinergic
system and causes the progression of glial tumors. Further studies with a large
number of patients are necessary to investigate the angiogenetic role of ELA in
glial tumors.

Apelin is a novel endogenous active peptide. The aim of this study is to
investigate whether apelin in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) can improve the
cardiac function in rats subjected to thoracic surgery trauma, and whether it is 
involved in the protective effect of electro-acupuncture (EA). Sprague-Dawley
rats were randomly divided into non-stressed group (control), thoracic surgical
trauma stressed group (trauma) and bilateral Neiguan EA applied on thoracic
surgical trauma stressed group (trauma + EA-PC 6). The mRNA expressions of apelin
receptor (APJR) and apelin in the PVN were detected by real time-PCR. The
exogenous apelin-13 (6 mmol/L, 0.1 μL) was microinjected into the rat PVN in the 
thoracic trauma group, and the effects of apelin-13 on the blood pressure (BP),
heart rate (HR) and the discharge of rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) neurons
were observed through the simultaneous recording technology by polygraph. The
results showed that the APJR mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the
rats of trauma group as compared with that in the control group (P < 0.05), and a
decline trend of apelin mRNA expression was also observed. EA application at
bilateral Neiguan acupoints partially recovered the decline of APJR and apelin
mRNA expression by the treatment of thoracic trauma. Both mean arterial pressure 
and HR in the thoracic surgical trauma group were significantly increased by the 
microinjection of exogenous apelin-13 into the PVN (P < 0.05), and the
single-unit discharge rate of RVLM neurons also had an increasing trend. These
results suggest that apelin in the PVN can improve the cardiac function of
thoracic surgical trauma rats, and may be involved in the protective effects of
EA.

Apelin is an endogenous peptide ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor
APJ/AGTRL1/APLNR and is widely expressed throughout human body. In adult hearts
Apelin-APJ/Apelin receptor axis is potently inotropic, vasodilatory, and
pro-angiogenic and thereby contributes to maintaining homeostasis in normal and
pathological hearts. Apelin-APJ/Apelin receptor is also involved in heart
development including endoderm differentiation, heart morphogenesis, and coronary
vascular formation. APJ/Apelin receptor had been originally identified as an
orphan receptor for its sequence similarity to Angiotensin II type 1 receptor,
and it was later deorphanized by identification of Apelin in 1998. Both Apelin
and Angiotensin II are substrates for Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
which degrades the peptides and thus negatively regulates their agonistic
activities. Elabela/Toddler, which shares little sequence homology with Apelin,
has been recently identified as a second endogenous APJ ligand. Elabela plays
crucial roles in heart development and disease conditions presumably at time
points or at areas of the heart different from Apelin. Apelin and Elabela seem to
constitute a spatiotemporal double ligand system to control APJ/Apelin receptor
signaling in the heart. These expanding knowledges of Apelin systems would
further encourage therapeutic applications of Apelin, Elabela, or their synthetic
derivatives for cardiovascular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Apelin receptor (APJ) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
activated by the endogenous peptide apelin. The apelin-APJ system has emerged as 
an important regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis. Recently, a potent
benzimidazole-derived apelin peptidomimetic, CMF-019, was patented but without a 
comprehensive description of its synthesis and a complete spectroscopic
characterization of the intermediates.
OBJECTIVE: Here, a detailed preparation of CMF-019 through a modified and
improved synthetic pathway is described.
METHOD: In particular, the benzimidazole ring in 7 was tailored by the
condensation of methyl 3- amino-4-(pentan-3-ylamino)benzoate (4) with
(thiophene-2-yl)acetimidate salt 6. Saponification of 7 and the subsequent
condensation of the free acid 8 with the corresponding enantiopure β-amino acid
methyl ester generated methyl
(S)-5-methyl-3-{1-(pentan-3-yl)-2-(thiophen-2-ylmethyl)-1Hbenzo[
d]imidazole-5-carboxamido}hexanoate (9). Hydrolysis of the latter with KOH in
THF/water, followed by HPLC-purification, afforded the desired product, CMF-019
(potassium salt) 10.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: The approach reported herein enables preparation of 10 at a
total yield of 12% over seven linear steps. Additionally, it does not require
applying expensive designated microwave reactors and high-pressure hydrogenators.
Thus, the elaborate synthesis provides a latent availability of potent agonist 10
for further exploring the physiologically essential apelin-APJ system.

Recent studies have suggested that apelin has a role in controlling female
reproduction. The aims of the present study were, firstly, to investigate the
gene expression (mRNA and protein) and immunolocalization of apelin and its
receptor APJ in corpora lutea (CL) of pigs collected during the early (CL1),
middle (CL2) and late (CL3) luteal phase. Using real time PCR and immunoblotting 
techniques, it was observed that apelin gene expression was similar in CL1 and
CL2, and less in CL3, while relative abundance APJ mRNA and abundance of the
protein were similar in CL1 and CL3 and greater in CL2. There was apelin staining
in the cytoplasm of both small (SC) and large (LC) luteal cells with the greatest
intensity in CL2. In the cytoplasm of CL1, only a few SC cells stained for APJ;
in CL2, APJ was located in the cell membrane of LC and in the cytoplasm of SC;
and in CL3 was located in the membrane with moderate cytoplasmic APJ staining.
Intense APJ staining was noted in epithelium of blood vessels of CL2-3. Secondly,
there was an effect of apelin on progesterone (P4) secretion in CL2 and on the
molecular mechanisms of these cells. Stimulatory effects of apelin on P4
secretion, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) activity and protein abundance
were observed and this was inhibited in response to APJ and adenosine
5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) kinase blockers. In conclusion,
the presence of apelin/APJ in the CL of pigs and stimulatory effects of apelin on
P4 secretion and 3β-HSD levels suggest potential auto/paracrine regulation by
apelin in the luteal phase of the estrous cycle. Moreover, the involvement of APJ
and AMPKα kinase in apelin activity in CL was confirmed.

Glioblastoma multiforme are mortifying brain tumors that contain a subpopulation 
of tumor cells with stem-like properties, termed as glioblastoma stem-like cells 
(GSCs). These GSCs constitute an autonomous reservoir of aberrant cells able to
initiate, maintain, and repopulate the tumor mass. A new therapeutic strategy
would consist of targeting the GSC population. The GSCs are situated in
perivascular niches, closely associated with brain microvascular endothelial
cells thereby involved in bidirectional molecular and cellular interactions. In
this scenario, the endothelium not only supplies oxygen and necessary nutrients
but also seeds a protective microenvironment for tumor growth. Although GSC fate,
plasticity, and survival are regulated by external cues emanating from
endothelial cells, the nature of such angiocrine signals remains unknown. Our
laboratory conclusively demonstrated that brain endothelial cells positively
control the expansion of GSCs.1 Notably, we found that GSCs are addicted to the
hormonal peptide apelin (APLN) secreted by surrounding endothelial cells, and
identified the APLN/APLNR nexus as a promising druggable network in glioblastoma.

The apelinergic system is an important player in the regulation of both vascular 
tone and cardiovascular function, making this physiological system an attractive 
target for drug development for hypertension, heart failure and ischemic heart
disease. Indeed, apelin exerts a positive inotropic effect in humans whilst
reducing peripheral vascular resistance. In this study, we investigated the
signaling pathways through which apelin exerts its hypotensive action. We
synthesized a series of apelin-13 analogs whereby the C-terminal Phe13 residue
was replaced by natural or unnatural amino acids. In HEK293 cells expressing APJ,
we evaluated the relative efficacy of these compounds to activate Gαi1 and GαoA
G-proteins, recruit β-arrestins 1 and 2 (βarrs), and inhibit cAMP production.
Calculating the transduction ratio for each pathway allowed us to identify
several analogs with distinct signaling profiles. Furthermore, we found that
these analogs delivered i.v. to Sprague-Dawley rats exerted a wide range of
hypotensive responses. Indeed, two compounds lost their ability to lower blood
pressure, while other analogs significantly reduced blood pressure as apelin-13. 
Interestingly, analogs that did not lower blood pressure were less effective at
recruiting βarrs. Finally, using Spearman correlations, we established that the
hypotensive response was significantly correlated with βarr recruitment but not
with G protein-dependent signaling. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that 
the βarr recruitment potency is involved in the hypotensive efficacy of activated
APJ.

The cause of the invalid reaction of smooth muscle cells to mechanical
stimulation that results in a dysfunctional myogenic response that mediates the
disruption of renal blood flow (RBF) in patients with diabetes is debatable. The 
present study revealed that increased apelin concentration in serum of diabetic
mice neutralized the myogenic response mediated by apelin receptor (APJ) and
resulted in increased RBF, which promoted the progression of diabetic
nephropathy. The results showed that apelin concentration, RBF, and
albuminuria:creatinine ratio were all increased in kkAy mice, and increased RBF
correlated positively with serum apelin both in C57 and diabetic mice. The
increased RBF was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of myosin light chain 
(MLC), β-arrestin, and increased endothelial NOS in glomeruli. Meanwhile,
calcium, phosphorylation of MLC, and β-arrestin were decreased by high glucose
and apelin treatment in cultured smooth muscle cells, as well. eNOS was increased
by high glucose and increased by apelin in cultured endothelial cells (ECs).
Knockdown of β-arrestin expression in smooth muscle cells cancelled
phosphorylation of MLC induced by apelin. Therefore, apelin may induce the
progression of diabetic nephropathy by counteracting the myogenic response in
smooth muscle cells.-Zhang, J., Yin, J., Wang, Y., Li, B., Zeng, X. Apelin
impairs myogenic response to induce diabetic nephropathy in mice.

The presence, within the human bone marrow, of cells with both endothelial and
hemogenic potential has been controversial. Herein, we identify, within the human
fetal bone marrow, prior to establishment of hematopoiesis, a unique APLNR+,
Stro-1+ cell population, co-expressing markers of early mesodermal precursors
and/or hemogenic endothelium. In adult marrow, cells expressing similar markers
are also found, but at very low frequency. These adult-derived cells can be
extensively culture expanded in vitro without loss of potential, they preserve a 
biased hemogenic transcriptional profile, and, upon in vitro induction with OCT4,
assume a hematopoietic phenotype. In vivo, these cells, upon transplantation into
a fetal microenvironment, contribute to the vasculature, and generate
hematopoietic cells that provide multilineage repopulation upon serial
transplantation. The identification of this human somatic cell population
provides novel insights into human ontogenetic hematovascular potential, which
could lead to a better understanding of, and new target therapies for, malignant 
and nonmalignant hematologic disorders.

The apelin receptor generates increasing interest as a potential target across
several cardiovascular indications. However, the short half-life of its cognate
ligands, the apelin peptides, is a limiting factor for pharmacological use. In
this study, we systematically explored each position of apelin-13 to find the
best position to cyclize the peptide, with the goal to improve its stability
while optimizing its binding affinity and signaling profile. Macrocyclic
analogues showed a remarkably higher stability in rat plasma (half-life >3 h
versus 24 min for Pyr-apelin-13), accompanied by improved affinity (analogue 15, 
Ki 0.15 nM and t1/2 6.8 h). Several compounds displayed higher inotropic effects 
ex vivo in the Langendorff isolated heart model in rats (analogues 13 and 15,
maximum response at 0.003 nM versus 0.03 nM of apelin-13). In conclusion, this
study provides stable and active compounds to better characterize the
pharmacology of the apelinergic system.

The principal function of glomeruli is to filter blood through a highly
specialized filtration barrier consisting of a fenestrated endothelium, the
glomerular basement membrane and podocyte foot processes. Previous studies have
uncovered a crucial role of endothelial a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10
(ADAM10) and Notch signaling in the development of glomeruli, yet the resulting
defects have not been further characterized nor understood in the context of
kidney development. Here, we used several different experimental approaches to
analyze the kidneys and glomeruli from mice lacking ADAM10 in endothelial cells
(A10ΔEC mice). Scanning electron microscopy of glomerular casts demonstrated
enlarged vascular diameter and increased intussusceptive events in A10ΔEC
glomeruli compared to controls. Consistent with these findings, genes known to
regulate vessel caliber (Apln, AplnR and Vegfr3) are significantly upregulated in
A10ΔEC glomeruli. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed the
persistence of diaphragms in the fenestrae of A10ΔEC glomerular endothelial
cells, which was corroborated by the elevated expression of the protein
PLVAP/PV-1, an integral component of fenestral diaphragms. Analysis of gross
renal vasculature by light sheet microscopy showed no major alteration of the
branching pattern, indicating a localized importance of ADAM10 in the glomerular 
endothelium. Since intussusceptions and fenestrae with diaphragms are normally
found in developing, but not mature glomeruli, our results provide the first
evidence for a crucial role of endothelial ADAM10, a key regulator of Notch
signaling, in promoting the development and maturation of the glomerular
vasculature.

Hypertension is an important health problem that is manifested by systemic
arterial blood pressure being permanently elevated and leading to serious
complications. Hypertension is the basis for coronary heart diseases, heart
failure, kidney damage, cerebrovascular diseases. Due to ethical concerns, there 
is no detailed study of the mechanism, side effects and treatment of hypertension
in humans. For this reason, specific studies related to the organ of hypertension
are performed in experimental animals. The heart and kidney tissue, which are the
most important organs that hypertension has damaged, have formed specific organs 
of our work. In our experimental study, a total of 35 (hypertensive group: 20,
control group: 15) Rattus Norvegicus Wistar albino rats were used. In order to
obtain our hypertension model, our experimental animals were given L-NAME
together with drinking water for six weeks. After six weeks, the experimental
procedures were terminated. Heart and kidney tissues of the hypertensive and
control group were obtained. Expression of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) was
demonstrated by immunohistochemical and Western Blot protocols. Hypertrophic
cardiac atrium of the hearts of the large cavities, interventricular septum and
myocardium to the disintegration, as well as an increase in the diameter of the
coronary artery has been observed. In general, kidney tissues of the hypertensive
group showed narrowing in cortical renal structures and enlargement in structures
in the renal medulla. As a result, in hypertensive cases, there was an increase
in expression of Apelin and APJ receptor in heart tissue, and a decrease in
expression of Apelin and APJ receptor in kidney tissue. We think that our
findings may contribute to experimental or clinical studies related to
hypertension and apelin.

PURPOSE: Apelin treatment has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in
insulin resistant mice by acting in skeletal muscles. However, the effects of
systemic apelin on the hepatic energy metabolism have not been addressed. We thus
aimed to determine the effect of chronic apelin treatment on the hepatic lipid
metabolism in insulin resistant mice. The apelin receptor (APJ) expression was
also studied in this context since its regulation has only been reported in
severe liver pathologies.
METHODS: Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) in order to become obese and insulin
resistant compared to chow fed mice (CD). HFD mice then received a daily
intraperitoneal injection of apelin (0.1 µmol/kg) or PBS during 28 days.
RESULTS: Triglycerides content and the expression of different
lipogenesis-related genes were significantly decreased in the liver of HFD
apelin-treated compared to PBS-treated mice. Moreover, at this stage of insulin
resistance, the beta-oxidation was increased in liver homogenates of HFD
PBS-treated mice compared to CD mice and reduced in HFD apelin-treated mice.
Finally, APJ expression was not up-regulated in the liver of insulin resistant
mice. In isolated hepatocytes from chow and HFD fed mice, apelin did not induce
significant effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results suggest that systemic apelin treatment
decreases steatosis in insulin resistant mice without directly targeting
hepatocytes.

The adaption of endothelial cells to local flow conditions is a multifunctional
process which leads to distinct alterations in cell shape, the subcellular
distribution of structural proteins, and cellular function. G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) have been identified to be fundamentally involved in such
processes. Recently, we and others have shown that the expression of the
endothelial GPCR apelin receptor (APJ) is regulated by fluid flow and that
activation of APJ participates in signaling pathways which are related to
processes of mechanotransduction. The present study aims to illuminate these
findings by further visualization of APJ function. We show that APJ is located to
the cellular junctions and might thus be associated with platelet endothelial
cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing of APJ expression influences the
shear-induced adaption of HUVEC in terms of cytoskeletal remodeling, cellular
elasticity, cellular motility, attachment, and distribution of adhesion
complexes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that APJ is crucial for
complemented endothelial adaption to local flow conditions.

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an unlimited source for generating
various kinds of functional blood cells. However, efficient strategies for
generating large-scale functional blood cells from hPSCs are still lacking, and
the mechanism underlying human hematopoiesis remains largely unknown. In this
study, we identified myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (MEIS1) as 
a crucial regulator of hPSC early hematopoietic differentiation. MEIS1 is vital
for specification of APLNR+ mesoderm progenitors to functional hemogenic
endothelial progenitors (HEPs), thereby controlling formation of hematopoietic
progenitor cells (HPCs). TAL1 mediates the function of MEIS1 in HEP
specification. In addition, MEIS1 is vital for megakaryopoiesis and
thrombopoiesis from hPSCs. Mechanistically, FLI1 acts as a downstream gene
necessary for the function of MEIS1 during megakaryopoiesis. Thus, MEIS1 controls
human hematopoiesis in a stage-specific manner and can be potentially manipulated
for large-scale generation of HPCs or platelets from hPSCs for therapeutic
applications in regenerative medicine.

Apelin and apela (ELABELA/ELA/Toddler) are two peptide ligands for a class A
G-protein-coupled receptor named the apelin receptor (AR/APJ/APLNR). Ligand-AR
interactions have been implicated in regulation of the adipoinsular axis,
cardiovascular system, and central nervous system alongside pathological
processes. Each ligand may be processed into a variety of bioactive isoforms
endogenously, with apelin ranging from 13 to 55 amino acids and apela from 11 to 
32, typically being cleaved C-terminal to dibasic proprotein convertase cleavage 
sites. The C-terminal region of the respective precursor protein is retained and 
is responsible for receptor binding and subsequent activation. Interestingly,
both apelin and apela exhibit isoform-dependent variability in potency and
efficacy under various physiological and pathological conditions, but most
studies focus on a single isoform. Biophysical behavior and structural properties
of apelin and apela isoforms show strong correlations with functional studies,
with key motifs now well determined for apelin. Unlike its ligands, the AR has
been relatively difficult to characterize by biophysical techniques, with most
characterization to date being focused on effects of mutagenesis. This situation 
may improve following a recently reported AR crystal structure, but there are
still barriers to overcome in terms of comprehensive biophysical study. In this
review, we summarize the three components of the apelinergic system in terms of
structure-function correlation, with a particular focus on isoform-dependent
properties, underlining the potential for regulation of the system through
multiple endogenous ligands and isoforms, isoform-dependent pharmacological
properties, and biological membrane-mediated receptor interaction. © 2018

The strategy of applying fluorine NMR to characterize ligand binding to a
membrane protein prepared with mixtures of tryptophans substituted with F at
different positions on the indole ring was tested. The 19 F NMR behavior of 4-,
5-, 6-, and 7-fluorotryptophan were directly compared as a function of both
micellar environment and fragment size for two overlapping apelin receptor
(AR/APJ) segments; one with a single transmembrane (TM) helix and two tryptophan 
residues, the other with three TM helices and two additional tryptophan residues.
Chemical shifts, peak patterns, and nuclear spin relaxation rates were observed
to vary as a function of micellar conditions and F substitution position in the
indole ring, with the exposure of a given residue to micelle or solvent being the
primary differentiating factor. Titration of the 3-TM AR segment biosynthetically
prepared as a mixture of 5- and 7-fluorotryptophan-containing isoforms by two
distinct peptide ligands (apelin-36 and apela-32) demonstrated site-specific 19 F
peak intensity changes for one ligand but not the other. In contrast, both
ligands perturbed 1 H-15 N HSQC peak patterns to a similar degree.
Characterization of multiple fluorotryptophan types for a given set of tryptophan
residues, thus, significantly augments the potential to apply 19 F NMR to track
otherwise obscure modulation of protein conformation and dynamics without an
explicit requirement for mutagenesis or chemical modification.

Stroke is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Genetic risk factors 
have been found to play important roles in the pathology of ischemic stroke. In a
previous genome-wide association study, a functional variant (rs9943582, -154G/A)
in the 5' flanking region of the apelin receptor gene (APLNR) was shown to be
significantly associated with stroke in the Japanese population. However, the
association required validation in other ethnicities. To validate the genetic
relationship between APLNR and ischemic stroke in the Chinese Han population, we 
genotyped rs9943582 in a case-control population containing 1,158 ischemic stroke
patients and 1,265 common controls enrolled from the GeneID database, and
performed a genetic association study. We detected no allelic or genotypic
associations between rs9943582 and ischemic stroke in the Chinese Han GeneID
population, although the study population provided sufficient statistical power. 
This finding indicates that the association between the APLNR variant and
ischemic stroke or atherosclerosis may need further validation.

It is known that dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission 
plays an important role in ischemic injury of myocardial infarction (MI). Apelin,
an endogenous ligand for Apelin receptor, acts as a key modulator of
cardiovascular diseases. Here, we examined the effects of Apelin on MI injury and
underlying mechanisms. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were treated with Apelin for 4
weeks and then subjected coronary artery ligation (LAD) to induce MI and the
protective effects of Apelin on MI injury were evaluated at 6 h post LAD.
Mitochondrial fission was significantly increased in MI as evidenced by enhanced 
expression of phosphorylated Drp1 (p-Drp1ser 616) without affecting total Drp-1
level and degenerative transformation of mitochondria into short rods as typical 
fission. Apelin markedly inhibited p-Drp1ser 616 and preserved mitochondrial
morphology in MI. Similar effects of Apelin were consistently observed in primary
cultured cardiomyocytes under hypoxia. Apelin decreased hypoxia-induced
cardiomyocyte apoptosis as evidenced by decreased TUNEL-positive cells and
preserved mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Apelin decreased Bax/Bcl-2
ratio and limited the release of cytochrome C and activation of caspase-9 and
caspase-3 both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, Apelin diminished the infarct size 
and normalized the impaired cardiac function as indicated by rescuing of the
decreased ejection faction and fractional shortening in MI mice. In conclusion,
Apelin prevented mitochondrial fission by inhibiting p-Drp1Ser616, which prevents
loss of MMP and inhibits the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These results
indicate that the inhibition of Drp-1 activation by Apelin is a novel mechanism
of cardioprotection against MI injury.

BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular system is a primary target of stress and stress is
the most important etiologic factor in cardiovascular diseases. Stressors
increase expressions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and apelin in cardiac
tissue.
AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether stress-induced
apelin has an effect on the expression of ANP in the right atrium of rat heart.
METHODS: The rats were divided into the control, stress and F13A+stress groups.
In the stress and F13A+stress groups, the rats were subjected to water immersion 
and restraint stress (WIRS) for 6h. In the F13A+stress group, apelin receptor
antagonist F13A, was injected intravenously immediately before application of
WIRS. The plasma samples were obtained for the measurement of corticosterone and 
atrial natriuretic peptide. The atrial samples were used for immunohistochemistry
and western blot analysis.
RESULTS: F13A administration prevented the rise of plasma corticosterone and ANP 
levels induced by WIRS. While WIRS application increased the expressions of
apelin, HIF-1α and ANP in atrial tissue, while F13A prevented the stress-induced 
increase in the expression of HIF-1α and ANP.
CONCLUSION: Stress-induced apelin induces ANP expression in atrial tissue and may
play a role in cardiovascular homeostasis by increasing ANP expression under WIRS
conditions.

Apelin is one of two peptide hormones that activate the apelin receptor (AR or
APJ) to regulate the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, and
adipoinsular axis. Here, we apply circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry and 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize the potential
membrane binding by the two longest bioactive apelin isoforms, apelin-55 and -36,
using membrane-mimetic dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
and 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (LPPG)
micelles. Pulsed field gradient diffusion NMR experiments demonstrated
preferential interaction of both apelin-55 and -36 with anionic SDS and LPPG
micelles over zwitterionic DPC micelles. Chemical shift perturbations and changes
in ps-ns scale dynamics of apelin-55 in all micelles were similarly localized
along the polypeptide backbone, demonstrating clear dependence upon detergent
headgroup, while comparison of chemical shifts between apelin-55 and apelin-36
showed negligible differences indicative of highly similar modes of micelle
interaction. Notably, the observed behaviour was consistent with an ensemble
averaged pair of free and bound states in fast exchange on the NMR timescale
proportional to the fraction of micelle-bound protein, implying a similar
conformational equilibrium regardless of headgroup and tailgroup. Membrane
catalysis of apelin-AR binding would thus give rise to analogous behaviour in the
essential C-terminal region common to all apelin isoforms.

Pathological retinal angiogenesis is caused by the progression of ischemic
retinal diseases and can result in retinal detachment and irreversible blindness.
This neovascularization is initiated from the retinal veins and their associated 
capillaries and involves the overgrowth of vascular endothelial cells. Since
expression of the apelin receptor (APJ) is restricted to the veins and
proliferative endothelial cells during physiological retinal angiogenesis, in the
present study, we investigated the effect of APJ inhibition on pathological
retinal angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). In
vitro experiments revealed that ML221, an APJ antagonist, suppressed
cultured-endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.
Intraperitoneal administration of ML221 inhibited pathological angiogenesis but
enhanced the recovery of normal vessels into the ischemic regions in the retina
of the OIR model mice. ML221 did not affect the expression levels of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR2) in the retina. APJ was
highly expressed in the endothelial cells within abnormal vessels but was only
detected in small amounts in morphologically normal vessels. These results
suggest that APJ inhibitors selectively prevent pathological retinal angiogenesis
and that the drugs targeting APJ may be new a candidate for treating ischemic
retinopathy.

Aging drives the occurrence of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Recent studies indicate that blood from young mice reduces
age-associated pathologies. However, the "anti-aging" factors in juvenile
circulation remain poorly identified. Here, we characterize the role of the
apelinergic axis in mammalian aging and identify apelin as an anti-aging factor. 
The expression of apelin (apln) and its receptor (aplnr) exhibits an
age-dependent decline in multiple organs. Reduced apln signaling perturbs
organismal homeostasis; mice harboring genetic deficiency of aplnr or apln
exhibit enhanced cardiovascular, renal, and reproductive aging. Genetic or
pharmacological abrogation of apln signaling also induces cellular senescence
mediated, in part, by the activation of senescence-promoting transcription
factors. Conversely, restoration of apln in 15-month-old wild-type mice reduces
cardiac hypertrophy and exercise-induced hypertensive response. Additionally,
apln-restored mice exhibit enhanced vigor and rejuvenated behavioral and
circadian phenotypes. Hence, a declining apelinergic axis promotes aging, whereas
its restoration extends the murine healthspan.

Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury-induced cellular apoptosis contributes
to neuronal death in ischemic stroke, while endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)
and subsequently triggered unfolded protein response (UPR) are the major
mechanisms of cerebral I/R injury-induced apoptosis. A number of studies
indicated that apelin-13 protects neurons from I/R injury-induced apoptosis.
Apelin-36, the longest isoform of apelin, has stronger affinity to apelin
receptor than apelin-13 does. However, the role of apelin-36 in ischemic stroke
is less studied. In addition, preventive administration of apelin was applied in 
most studies, which could not precisely reflect its therapeutic potential in
ischemic stroke. Here, we first reported that low dose of apelin-36, other than
apelin-13, administrated after ischemic stroke significantly reduced infarct
volume in rats. Moreover, apelin-36 attenuated cerebral I/R injury-induced
apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, apelin-36 suppressed I/R
injury-induced CHOP and GRP78 elevation, indicating that apelin-36 inhibited
ERS/UPR activation. Our study first demonstrated that post-stroke administration 
of low-dose apelin-36 could attenuate cerebral I/R injury-induced infarct and
apoptosis, which is associated with the inhibition of cerebral I/R injury-induced
ERS/UPR activation. Our data support the therapeutic potential of apelin-36 in
ischemic stroke although further investigation is needed.

OBJECTIVE: APELA is a small, secreted peptide that can function as a ligand for
the G-protein coupled receptor, Apelin Receptor (APLNR, APJ). APELA plays an
essential role in endoderm differentiation and cardiac development during
embryogenesis. We investigated whether APELA exerts any functions in cancer
progression.
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing datasets, microarray from 
an OCCC mouse model, and RNA isolated from fresh frozen and FFPE patient tissue
were used to assess APELA expression. APELA knockout ovarian clear cell carcinoma
(OCCC) cell lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9.
RESULTS: APELA was expressed in various ovarian cancer histotypes and was
especially elevated in OCCC. Disruption of APELA expression in OCCC cell lines
suppressed cell growth and migration, and altered cell-cycle progression.
Moreover, addition of human recombinant APELA peptide to the OCCC cell line OVISE
promoted cell growth and migration. Interestingly, OVISE cells do not express
APLNR, suggesting that APELA can function through an APLNR-independent pathway.
Furthermore, APELA affected cell growth and cell cycle progression in a
p53-dependent manner. In addition, APELA knockdown induced p53 expression in
cancer cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings uncover a potential oncogenic role for APELA in
promoting ovarian tumour progression and provide a possible therapeutic strategy 
in ovarian cancer by targeting APELA.

Comparative analyses of transcriptional profiles from humans and mice with
cardiovascular pathologies revealed consistently elevated expression of MICU2, a 
regulatory subunit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex. To determine
if MICU2 expression was cardioprotective, we produced and characterized Micu2-/- 
mice. Mutant mice had left atrial enlargement and Micu2-/- cardiomyocytes had
delayed sarcomere relaxation and cytosolic calcium reuptake kinetics, indicating 
diastolic dysfunction. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of Micu2-/- ventricular tissues
revealed markedly reduced transcripts encoding the apelin receptor (Micu2-/- vs. 
wild type, P = 7.8 × 10-40), which suppresses angiotensin II receptor signaling
via allosteric transinhibition. We found that Micu2-/- and wild-type mice had
comparable basal blood pressures and elevated responses to angiotensin II
infusion, but that Micu2-/- mice exhibited systolic dysfunction and 30% lethality
from abdominal aortic rupture. Aneurysms and rupture did not occur with
norepinephrine-induced hypertension. Aortic tissue from Micu2-/- mice had
increased expression of extracellular matrix remodeling genes, while single-cell 
RNA-seq analyses showed increased expression of genes related to reactive oxygen 
species, inflammation, and proliferation in fibroblast and smooth muscle cells.
We concluded that Micu2-/- mice recapitulate features of diastolic heart disease 
and define previously unappreciated roles for Micu2 in regulating angiotensin
II-mediated hypertensive responses that are critical in protecting the abdominal 
aorta from injury.

Glioblastoma are highly aggressive brain tumours that are associated with an
extremely poor prognosis. Within these tumours exists a subpopulation of highly
plastic self-renewing cancer cells that retain the ability to expand ex vivo as
tumourspheres, induce tumour growth in mice, and have been implicated in radio-
and chemo-resistance. Although their identity and fate are regulated by external 
cues emanating from endothelial cells, the nature of such signals remains
unknown. Here, we used a mass spectrometry proteomic approach to characterize the
factors released by brain endothelial cells. We report the identification of the 
vasoactive peptide apelin as a central regulator for endothelial-mediated
maintenance of glioblastoma patient-derived cells with stem-like properties.
Genetic and pharmacological targeting of apelin cognate receptor abrogates
apelin- and endothelial-mediated expansion of glioblastoma patient-derived cells 
with stem-like properties in vitro and suppresses tumour growth in vivo.
Functionally, selective competitive antagonists of apelin receptor were shown to 
be safe and effective in reducing tumour expansion and lengthening the survival
of intracranially xenografted mice. Therefore, the apelin/apelin receptor
signalling nexus may operate as a paracrine signal that sustains tumour cell
expansion and progression, suggesting that apelin is a druggable factor in
glioblastoma.

The expression of apelin and its receptors (APJ) in central autonomic networks
suggests that apelin may regulate gastrointestinal motor functions. In rodents,
central administration of apelin-13 has been shown to inhibit gastric emptying;
however, the mechanisms involved remain to be determined. Using male adult
Sprague-Dawley rats, the aims of the present study were 1) to determine the
expression of APJ receptor in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), 2) to assess the
effects of central application of apelin-13 into the DVC on gastric tone and
motility, and 3) to investigate the neuronal pathways responsible for
apelin-induced alterations. APJ receptor immunoreactivity was detected in
gastric-projecting and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons of the DVC.
Microinjection of apelin-13 into the DVC significantly decreased gastric tone and
motility in both corpus and antrum. The apelin-induced reduction in gastric tone 
and motility was prevented by surgical vagotomy or fourth ventricular application
of the APJ receptor antagonist, [Ala13]apelin-13 (F13A). Systemic administration 
of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, but not the nitric oxide synthase
inhibitor nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), abolished the apelin-induced
inhibitory responses. The present results indicate a central modulatory role of
apelin in the vagal neurocircuitry that controls gastric motor functions via
withdrawal of the tonically active cholinergic pathway. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is 
the first study investigating the effects induced by brain stem application of
apelin-13 while monitoring gastric tone and motility in rats. We have found that 
gastric-projecting neurons of the dorsal vagal complex express apelin receptors
(APJ), which mediate the inhibitory actions of apelin-13. The inhibitory effects 
of apelin were abolished by systemic preadministration of atropine, but not
nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). Apelin seems to modulate gastric motility
via withdrawal of the tonically active vagal cholinergic pathway.

AIMS: Kappa Opioid receptors (KORs) change the impact of apelin on the
phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2). However, the role of interaction between KOR and
apelin receptors (APJ) on the cardiac contractility effects of apelin and in
regulation of pERK1/2 and PKC in the heart of renovascular hypertensive (2K1C)
rats is unknown.
MAIN METHODS: Hemodynamic factors, the heterodimerization of KOR and APJ, the
expression of KOR mRNA and protein and pERK1/2 in the left ventricle of 2K1C rats
were measured following APJ, KOR, PKC and Gi path inhibition by F13A, nor-BNI,
chelerythrine and PTX respectively.
KEY FINDINGS: Apelin in 40 and 60μg/kg doses increased cardiac contractility, and
reduced mean arterial pressure. The cardiac impacts in both doses were reduced by
F13A, nor-BNI and chelerytrine and blocked by PTX. Hypertension increased the
expression of KORs and heterodimerization of APJ and KOR, and reduced pERK1/2 in 
the left ventricle. Apelin, in both doses reduced (normalized) heterodimerization
and recovered the reduction in pERK1/2. The recovery of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
was accompanied by reduction of KOR and APJ heterodimerization.
SIGNIFICANCE: 2K1C hypertension increased the expression of KORs and
heterodimerization of APJ and KORs. The heterodimerization was associated by
reduction of ERK phosphorylation and altered the cardiac inotropic and lusitropic
effects of apelin. These changes may participate in pathophysiology of cardiac
dysfunction in renovascular hypertension that is associated with subnormal level 
of serum apelin. Apelin- induced recovery of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and KOR-APJ
dimerization may nominate apelin as a therapeutic goal in treatment of this kind 
of hypertension.

Elabela (ELA), the second peptide ligand for the apelin receptor, APLNR, was
previously found in lower vertebrates to be crucial for endoderm and cardiac
development. Two new studies report on the phenotypes of Ela null mice, ranging
from defective embryogenesis to preeclampsia, providing new insights and raising 
greater intrigue on this cardiometabolic pathway.

The apelin peptide is described as one of the most potent inotropic agents,
produced endogenously in a wide range of cells, including cardiomyocytes. Despite
positive effects on cardiac contractility in multicellular preparations, as well 
as indications of cardio-protective actions in several diseases, its effects and 
mechanisms of action at the cellular level are incompletely understood. Here, we 
report apelin effects on dynamic mechanical characteristics of single ventricular
cardiomyocytes, isolated from mouse models (control, apelin-deficient
[Apelin-KO], apelin-receptor KO mouse [APJ-KO]), and rat. Dynamic changes in
maximal velocity of cell shortening and relaxation were monitored. In addition,
more traditional indicators of inotropic effects, such as maximum shortening (in 
mechanically unloaded cells) or peak force development (in auxotonic contracting 
cells, preloaded using the carbon fibre technique) were studied. The key finding 
is that, using Apelin-KO cardiomyocytes exposed to different preloads with the
2-carbon fibre technique, we observe a lowering of the slope of the end-diastolic
stress-length relation in response to 10 nM apelin, an effect that is
preload-dependent. This suggests a positive lusitropic effect of apelin, which
could explain earlier counter-intuitive findings on an apelin-induced increase in
contractility occurring without matching rise in oxygen consumption.

It is well established that apelin-APLNR (apelin receptor) pathway plays a
central role in cardiovascular system. In this meta-analysis, we summarized
published results on circulating apelin concentration in association with
coronary artery disease (CAD), apelin and APLNR genetic polymorphism(s) in
predisposition to CAD risk and circulating apelin changes after surgical
treatment for CAD. The results from 15 articles were pooled. Two authors
independently took charge of literature search, article selection and information
collection. Overall, circulating apelin concentration was significantly lower in 
CAD patients (N=1021) than in controls (N=654) (weighted mean difference [WMD]:
-1.285 ng/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.790 to -0.780, P<0001), with
significant heterogeneity (I2=99.3%) but without publication bias. For the
association of APLNR gene rs9943582 polymorphism with CAD (patients/controls:
5975/4717), the mutant T allele was associated with a 5.2% increased risk
relative to the wild C allele (odds ratio: 1.052, 95% CI: 0.990 to 1.117,
P=0.100), without heterogeneity (I2=0.0%) or publication bias. Circulating apelin
was increased significantly after surgical treatment for CAD (N=202) (WMD: 2.011 
ng/mL, 95% CI: 0.541 to 3.481, P=0.007), with significant heterogeneity
(I2=98.0%). Stratified analyses showed that circulating apelin was significantly 
reduced in studies with age- and sex-matched patients and controls (WMD: -1.881
ng/mL, 95% CI: -2.457 to -1.304, P<0.001) and with total sample size ≥125 (WMD:
-1.657 ng/mL, 95% CI: -2.378 to -0.936, P<0.001), relative to studies without
matching reports and with total sample size <125. In brief, our results suggested
that circulating apelin was a prominent athero-protective marker against the
development of CAD.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common type of cardiomyopathy that
account for the majority of heart failure cases. The present study aimed to
reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of DCM and provide potential
biomarkers for detection of this condition. The public dataset of GSE35108 was
downloaded, and 4 normal induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
cardiomyocytes (N samples) and 4 DCM iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (DCM samples)
were utilized. Raw data were preprocessed, followed by identification of
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between N and DCM samples. Crucial
functions and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were investigated, and
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted. Furthermore, a 
module network was extracted from the PPI network, followed by enrichment
analysis. A set of 363 DEGs were identified, including 253 upregulated and 110
downregulated genes. Several biological processes (BPs), such as blood vessel
development and vasculature development (FLT1 and MMP2), cell adhesion (CDH1,
ITGB6, COL6A3, COL6A1 and LAMC2) and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor
interaction pathway (CDH1, ITGB6, COL6A3, COL6A1 and LAMC2), were significantly
enriched by these DEGs. Among them, MMP2, CDH1 and FLT1 were hub nodes in the PPI
network, while COL6A3, COL6A1, LAMC2 and ITGB6 were highlighted in module 3
network. In addition, PENK and APLNR were two crucial nodes in module 2, which
were linked to each other. In conclusion, several potential biomarkers for DCM
were identified, such as MMP2, FLT1, CDH1, ITGB6, COL6A3, COL6A1, LAMC2, PENK and
APLNR. These genes may serve significant roles in DCM via involvement of various 
BPs, such as blood vessel and vasculature development and cell adhesion, and the 
ECM-receptor interaction pathway.

Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to pose an important clinical
challenge, with most existing therapies lacking demonstrable ability to improve
cardiovascular outcomes. The atheroprotective peptide apelin (APLN) enhances
glucose utilization and improves insulin sensitivity. However, the mechanism of
these effects remains poorly defined. We demonstrate that the expression of APLNR
(APJ/AGTRL1), the only known receptor for apelin, is predominantly restricted to 
the endothelial cells (ECs) of multiple adult metabolic organs, including
skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Conditional endothelial-specific deletion of 
Aplnr (AplnrECKO ) resulted in markedly impaired glucose utilization and
abrogation of apelin-induced glucose lowering. Furthermore, we identified
inactivation of Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and inhibition of endothelial
expression of fatty acid (FA) binding protein 4 (FABP4) as key downstream
signaling targets of apelin/APLNR signaling. Both the Apln-/- and AplnrECKO mice 
demonstrated increased endothelial FABP4 expression and excess tissue FA
accumulation, whereas concurrent endothelial Foxo1 deletion or pharmacologic
FABP4 inhibition rescued the excess FA accumulation phenotype of the Apln-/-
mice. The impaired glucose utilization in the AplnrECKO mice was associated with 
excess FA accumulation in the skeletal muscle. Treatment of these mice with an
FABP4 inhibitor abrogated these metabolic phenotypes. These findings provide
mechanistic insights that could greatly expand the therapeutic repertoire for
type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders.

Apela (also known as Elabela, Ende, and Toddler) is a small signaling peptide
that activates the G-protein-coupled receptor Aplnr to stimulate cell migration
during zebrafish gastrulation. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a null,
reporter-expressing allele, we study the role of Apela in the developing mouse
embryo. We found that loss of Apela results in low-penetrance cardiovascular
defects that manifest after the onset of circulation. Three-dimensional
micro-computed tomography revealed a higher penetrance of vascular remodeling
defects, from which some mutants recover, and identified extraembryonic anomalies
as the earliest morphological distinction in Apela mutant embryos.
Transcriptomics at late gastrulation identified aberrant upregulation of
erythroid and myeloid markers in mutant embryos prior to the appearance of
physical malformations. Double-mutant analyses showed that loss of Apela
signaling impacts early Aplnr-expressing mesodermal populations independently of 
the alternative ligand Apelin, leading to lethal cardiac defects in some Apela
null embryos.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process whereby fully
differentiated epithelial cells transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. Apelin, a bioactive peptide,
has recently been recognized to protect against renal profibrotic activity, but
the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we
investigated the regulation of EMT in the presence of apelin-13 in vitro.
Expression of the mesenchymal marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and the
epithelial marker E-cadherin was examined by immunofluorescence and western
blotting in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)-stimulated human proximal 
tubular epithelial cells. Expression of extracellular matrix, fibronectin and
collagen-I was examined by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. F13A, an
antagonist of the apelin receptor APJ, and small interfering RNA targeting
protein kinase C epsilon (PKC-ε) were used to explore the relevant signaling
pathways. Apelin attenuated TGF-β1-induced EMT, and inhibited the EMT-associated 
increase in α-SMA, loss of E-cadherin, and secretion of extracellular matrix.
Moreover, apelin activated PKC-ε in tubular epithelial cells, which in turn
decreased phospho-Smad2/3 levels and increased Smad-7 levels. APJ inhibition or
PKC-ε deletion diminished apelin-induced modulation of Smad signaling and
suppression of tubular EMT. Our findings identify a novel PKC-ε-dependent
mechanism in which apelin suppresses TGF-β1-mediated activation of Smad signaling
pathways and thereby inhibits tubular EMT. These results suggest that apelin may 
be a new agent that can suppress renal fibrosis and retard chronic kidney disease
progression.

Apelin binds to the G protein-coupled apelin receptor (APJ; gene name aplnr) to
modulate diverse physiological systems including cardiovascular function, and
hydromineral and metabolic balance. Recently a second endogenous ligand for APJ, 
named apela, has been discovered. We confirm that apela activates signal
transduction pathways (ERK activation) in cells expressing the cloned rat APJ.
Previous studies suggest that exogenous apela is diuretic, attributable wholly or
in part to an action on renal APJ. Thus far the cellular distribution of apela in
the kidney has not been reported. We have utilized in situ hybridization
histochemistry to reveal strong apela labelling in the inner medulla (IM), with
lower levels observed in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM), of rat and
mouse kidneys. This contrasts with renal aplnr expression where the converse is
apparent, with intense labelling in the ISOM (consistent with vasa recta
labelling) and low-moderate hybridization in the IM, in addition to labelling of 
glomeruli. Apelin is found in sparsely distributed cells amongst more prevalent
aplnr-labelled cells in extra-tubular regions of the medulla. This expression
profile is supported by RNA-Seq data that shows that apela, but not apelin or
aplnr, is highly expressed in microdissected rat kidney tubules. If endogenous
tubular apela promotes diuresis in the kidney it could conceivably do this by
interacting with APJ in vasculature, or via an unknown receptor in the tubules.
The comparative distribution of apela, apelin and aplnr in the rodent kidney lays
the foundation for future work on how the renal apelinergic system interacts.

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by hepatic
steatosis and inflammation with or without fibrosis. The apelin receptor (APJ) is
related to angiotensin-like-receptor 1 (AGTRL1). The present study aimed to
evaluate APJ as an indicator of the pathophysiology of early-stage NASH.
METHODS: APJ expression was evaluated in six tissue samples with histologically
proven early-stage NASH using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoelectron
microscopy (IEM).
RESULTS: On IHC, in control liver tissue, APJ was mainly localized in the aortic 
artery, although APJ was detected only slightly in the sinusoids. In early NASH
liver tissue, on IEM, APJ was observed mainly at the sites of sinusoidal lining
cells around the central vein and periportal regions, and at arterial capillaries
in the portal tract. With regard to endothelial cells (ECs), one sample showed a 
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)/progenitor cell (HPC) partially wrapped with an EC.
CONCLUSION: HSCs/HPCs expressing APJ may contribute to the angiogenesis of liver 
tissue in early-stage NASH.

Somatic gene mutations can alter the vulnerability of cancer cells to
T-cell-based immunotherapies. Here we perturbed genes in human melanoma cells to 
mimic loss-of-function mutations involved in resistance to these therapies, by
using a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 library that consisted of around 123,000
single-guide RNAs, and profiled genes whose loss in tumour cells impaired the
effector function of CD8+ T cells. The genes that were most enriched in the
screen have key roles in antigen presentation and interferon-γ signalling, and
correlate with cytolytic activity in patient tumours from The Cancer Genome
Atlas. Among the genes validated using different cancer cell lines and antigens, 
we identified multiple loss-of-function mutations in APLNR, encoding the apelin
receptor, in patient tumours that were refractory to immunotherapy. We show that 
APLNR interacts with JAK1, modulating interferon-γ responses in tumours, and that
its functional loss reduces the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer and checkpoint
blockade immunotherapies in mouse models. Our results link the loss of essential 
genes for the effector function of CD8+ T cells with the resistance or
non-responsiveness of cancer to immunotherapies.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
the loss of brain dopaminergic neurons. Beside pharmacologic and symptomatic
treatment of PD the neuroprotective therapy has recently attracted more
attention. Apelin, a novel neuropeptide, and its receptors have numerous reported
roles in regulating brain functions. In addition, this peptide has potent
neuroprotective effects in some neurodegenerative situations. In this study, the 
effects of apelin-13 were investigated in a cell model of PD. Human neuroblastoma
SH-SY5Y cell damage was induced by 150 μM 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and the
cells viability was examined by MTT assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by fluorescence
spectrophotometry method. Immunoblotting analysis was also employed to evaluate
cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity. Data showed that 6-OHDA could
decrease cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential and increase
intracellular ROS, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Pretreatment of
SH-SY5Y cells with apelin-13 (5 and 10 nM) significantly prevented the mentioned 
biochemical and molecular markers of 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore,
the results showed that apelin receptor and PI3K signaling contributed to the
observed protective effects of apelin. The results suggest that apelin-13 has
protective effects against dopaminergic neural toxicity and its antioxidant and
antiapoptotic properties are involved, at least in part, in such protection.

BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine (CsA) usually reduces glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
but also can induce tubular injury without resulting in GFR reduction. Apelin is 
an endogenous ligand for the apelin receptor and has diverse physiologic roles
related to hemodynamic or metabolic processes. We investigated the renoprotective
role of apelin against CsA-induced tubular toxicity in rats.
METHODS: Rats were given CsA (15 mg/kg/day) and/or apelin-13 (15 μg/kg/day) for 7
days via subcutaneous injection. We performed serum and urinary assays of
creatinine and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) to estimate
renal injury and performed Western blotting for endothelial nitric oxide synthase
and nuclear factor of activated T-cell cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) to document the
underlying mechanism.
RESULTS: The CsA-treated group showed increased urinary creatinine excretion,
polyuria, and renal glycosuria without GFR reduction, suggesting adequate
CsA-induced renal tubular injury. Urinary NGAL excretion also increased
significantly in the CsA group. Conversely, apelin attenuated CsA-induced tubular
injury and had no effect on urinary NGAL excretion. In histopathologic
examination, the apelin-treated group had lower tubulo-interstitial injury scores
compared with those in the CsA group. Regarding the effects of apelin, our
results indicate that apelin provides protection against CsA-induced tubular
injury by activating nitric oxide and/or the NFATc1 pathway. Notably, we also
found that CsA inhibits renal glucose reabsorption by reducing Na+-K+ ATPase
expression and that apelin reverses reduced renal glucose reabsorption by CsA in 
tubular cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the renoprotective effect of apelin against
CsA-induced renal tubular toxicity and provides novel insights into the effects
of CsA and apelin on renal tubular cells.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a gestational hypertensive syndrome affecting between 5 and 
8% of all pregnancies. Although PE is the leading cause of fetal and maternal
morbidity and mortality, its molecular etiology is still unclear. Here, we show
that ELABELA (ELA), an endogenous ligand of the apelin receptor (APLNR, or APJ), 
is a circulating hormone secreted by the placenta. Elabela but not Apelin
knockout pregnant mice exhibit PE-like symptoms, including proteinuria and
elevated blood pressure due to defective placental angiogenesis. In mice,
infusion of exogenous ELA normalizes hypertension, proteinuria, and birth weight.
ELA, which is abundant in human placentas, increases the invasiveness of
trophoblast-like cells, suggesting that it enhances placental development to
prevent PE. The ELA-APLNR signaling axis may offer a new paradigm for the
treatment of common pregnancy-related complications, including PE.

BACKGROUND: The variant rs9943582 of APLNR (apelin receptor) was identified by a 
large-scale study to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in a
Japanese population. We conducted this study to investigate the association
between the variant and age of onset and clinical outcomes of ischemic stroke in 
a Chinese population.
METHODS: Improved multiple ligase detection reaction was used to genotype the
variant. We compared the mean age at ischemic stroke onset with one-way ANOVA.
The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression
models were performed to analyze the association between the variant and clinical
outcomes (recurrence and death).
RESULTS: A total of 916 ischemic stroke patients were recruited for the study.
For age at ischemic stroke onset, no significant association was identified with 
the variant in any genetic model. In addition, the variant was not strongly
associated with recurrence and death risk of ischemic stroke, as shown by the
results.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that the variant rs9943582 was not associated
with age at onset and clinical outcomes of ischemic stroke. However, evidence
from well-designed studies with larger and in different ethnic populations are
warranted to further explore the effects of APLNR on the ischemic stroke onset
and clinical outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the hematopoietic 
differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
METHODS: The role of DMSO in hematopoietic differentiation of hESC was
investigated by using a established stepwise hematopoietic differentiation system
from hESC, immunofluorescouse assay and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the window
phase of DMSO action was explored by adding it to the different stage of
hematopoietic differentiation.
RESULTS: Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis showed that DMSO
significantly promoted the generation of CD43+ hematopoietic progenitor cells
(HPC). The flow cytometry demonstrated that DMSO profoundly promoted the
generation of APLNR+ lateral plate mesoderm cells and CD31+CD34+ hemogenic
endothelium progenitors (HEP). The addition of DMSO in the window phase of
lateral plate mesoderm cell generation could markedly improve the generation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells.
CONCLUSION: DMSO promotes hematopoietic differentiation of hESC through enhancing
the generation of APLNR positive lateral plate mesoderm cells. The addition of
DMSO in the window phase of lateral plate mesoderm cell generation can
significantly improve the generation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Apelin, a (neuro)vasoactive peptide, plays a prominent role in controlling body
fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular functions. In animal models, experimental
data demonstrate that intracerebroventricular injection of apelin into lactating 
rats inhibits the phasic electrical activity of arginine vasopressin (AVP)
neurons, reduces plasma AVP levels, and increases aqueous diuresis. In the
kidney, apelin increases diuresis by increasing the renal microcirculation and by
counteracting the antidiuretic effect of AVP at the tubular level. Moreover,
after water deprivation or salt loading, in humans and in rodents, AVP and apelin
are conversely regulated to facilitate systemic AVP release and to avoid
additional water loss from the kidney. Furthermore, apelin and vasopressin
secretion are significantly altered in various water metabolism disorders
including hyponatremia and polyuria-polydipsia syndrome. Since the in vivo
half-life of apelin is in the minute range, metabolically stable apelin analogs
were developed. The efficacy of these lead compounds for decreasing AVP release
and increasing both renal blood flow and diuresis, make them promising candidates
for the treatment of water retention and/or hyponatremic disorders.

BACKGROUND: Apelin is a peptide ligand for a class A G-protein coupled receptor
called the apelin receptor (AR or APJ) that regulates angiogenesis, the
adipoinsular axis, and cardiovascular functions. Apelin has been shown to be
bioactive as 13, 17, and 36 amino acid isoforms, C-terminal fragments of the
putatively inactive 55-residue proprotein (proapelin or apelin-55). Although
intracellular proprotein processing has been proposed, isolation of apelin-55
from colostrum and milk demonstrates potential for secretion prior to processing 
and the possibility of proapelin-AR interaction.
METHODS: Apelin isoform activity and potency were compared by an In-Cell Western™
assay for ERK phosphorylation using a stably AR-transfected HEK293A cell line.
Conformational comparison of apelin isoforms was carried out by circular
dichroism and heteronuclear solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy.
RESULTS: Apelin-55 is shown to activate the AR, with similar maximum ERK
phophorylation response and potency to the shorter isoforms except for apelin-13,
which exhibited a greater potency. Correlating to this shared activity, highly
similar conformations are exhibited in all apelin isoforms for the shared
C-terminal region responsible for receptor binding and activation.
CONCLUSIONS: AR activation by all apelin isoforms likely hinges upon shared
conformation and dynamics in the C-terminus, with apelin-55 providing an
alternative bioactive isoform despite the addition of 19N-terminal residues
relative to apelin-36.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Beyond providing novel insight into the physiology of this 
system, re-annotation of proapelin to the bioactive apelin-55 isoform adds to the
molecular toolkit for dissection of apelin-AR interactions and expands the
repertoire of therapeutic targets for the apelinergic system.

Apelin, an endogenous ligand for apelin receptor (APJ), is reported to be
involved in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In this study, we explored the mechanism
of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by apelin-13/APJ system. Left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH) rat model was established by constricting the abdominal aorta. 
Western blots were used for protein expression in LVH rats and cultured H9c2
cardiomyocytes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to monitor
morphological features of cells. In addition, the diameter and volume of H9c2
cells were detected by Scepter™ Handheld Automated Cell Counter. We found that
the APJ was increased, but caveolin-1 was decreased in heart of LVH rats. In
addition, caveolin-1 was suppressed by apelin-13, and this effect was reversed by
APJ antagonist F13A in cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Apelin-13 not only
stimulated the formation of autophagolysosomes, autophagosome, and lysosomes but 
also increased the expression of autophagic markers Beclin-1 and LC3II/I.
Besides, the increase of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I was reversed by F13A or caveolin-1
overexpression and further enhanced by caveolin inhibitor. Furthermore, the
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy index brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) induced by
apelin-13 was blunt by F13A or autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and further
promoted by caveolin inhibitor. And caveolin-1 overexpression reduced the
diameter and volume of H9c2 cells induced by apelin-13. Our study indicates that 
caveolin-1-autophagy pathway mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by
apelin-13/APJ system, which might provide a novel therapeutic target for cardiac 
hypertrophy disease.

Apelin was thought to be an adipocyte-specific hormone, but recent studies
indicate a link between apelin and female reproductive function. Using real-time 
PCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and ELISA, we demonstrated expression
of apelin and its receptor (APJ) in ovarian follicles of different sizes from
mature pigs. Apelin concentration in the follicular fluid, and expression of both
apelin and APJ, increased with follicular growth; greatest values were found in
large follicles. Immunohistochemistry revealed the positive staining for apelin
and APJ in membranes of granulosa, than theca cells. Furthermore, we observed
strong expression of apelin in oocytes and APJ in the zona pellucida. The effect 
of apelin (0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 ng/ml) on basal and IGF1- and FSH-induced steroid 
hormone (progesterone [P4], and estradiol [E2]) secretion, steroidogenic enzyme
(3βHSD and CYP19A1) expression and cell proliferation (Alamar blue) was
determined. Apelin was found to increase basal steroid secretion, but decrease
IGF1- and FSH-induced steroid secretion, and 3βHSD and CYP19 expression. Apelin
also increased cell proliferation and the phosphorylation level of
5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidyl inositol 3'
kinase/Akt (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2). AMPKα was
involved in the action of apelin in P4 production, and MAPK/ERK and Akt/PI3
mediated the proliferative effect of apelin. However, these effects on steroid
secretion and cell proliferation were abolished when cultured in the presence of 
ML221, an APJ antagonist. In conclusion, apelin appears to regulate ovarian
follicular functions such as steroidogenesis and proliferation via APJ activation
and different signaling pathways.

Apelin receptor (APJR) is a key regulator of human cardiovascular function and is
activated by two different endogenous peptide ligands, apelin and Elabela, each
with different isoforms diversified by length and amino acid sequence. Here we
report the 2.6-Å resolution crystal structure of human APJR in complex with a
designed 17-amino-acid apelin mimetic peptide agonist. The structure reveals that
the peptide agonist adopts a lactam constrained curved two-site ligand binding
mode. Combined with mutation analysis and molecular dynamics simulations with
apelin-13 binding to the wild-type APJR, this structure provides a mechanistic
understanding of apelin recognition and binding specificity. Comparison of this
structure with that of other peptide receptors suggests that endogenous peptide
ligands with a high degree of conformational flexibility may bind and modulate
the receptors via a similar two-site binding mechanism.

APJ Is Associated with Treatment Response in Gastric Cancer Patients Receiving
Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy and Endostar Therapy.

BACKGROUND: Endostar combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been
used in patients with gastric cancers (GCs). However, there are no reliable
markers to predict the treatment response and prognosis of these patients. Apelin
and its receptor (APJ) are involved in angiogenesis in tumor tissues. We aimed to
study whether Apelin and Apelin receptor (APJ) tumor expression can predict the
treatment response of combination therapy of endostar and CRT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with locally advanced GC receiving
CRT only and CRT+endostar combination therapy. Apelin receptor (APJ) in tumor
samples was determined by immunohistological staining and scored by measuring
staining area and signal intensity.
RESULTS: The high APJ expression has significantly higher rates of tumor
invasion, local lymph node, and distant metastasis (all p < 0.001). In the CRT
only group, the distribution of high and low APJ expression in patients with good
and poor treatment response to CRT is not significantly different (p = 0.235).
However, in the CRT+endostar group, the chance of having poor response to
combined treatment is 3.645-fold higher in those having high APJ expression
levels than those who have low APJ expression levels. Our prognostic analysis
shows that in the CRT+endostar group, high APJ expression had significantly
shorter overall survival (OS) period than those with low APJ expression
(p < 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate survival analysis reveals that the APJ
expression is an independent predictor for the OS period in GC patients treated
with CRT+endostar.
CONCLUSION: Tumor APJ can be used to predict the therapy response and prognosis
in GC patients receiving CRT+endostar therapy.

Detergent micelles are frequently employed as membrane mimetics for
solution-state membrane protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here we 
compare topology, structure, ps-ns time-scale dynamics, and hydrodynamics of a
model protein with one transmembrane (TM) segment (residues 1-55 of the apelin
receptor, APJ, a G-protein-coupled receptor) in three distinct, commonly used
micellar environments. In each environment, two solvent-protected helical
segments connected by a solvent-exposed kink were observed. The break in helical 
character at the kink was maintained in a helix-stabilizing fluorinated alcohol
environment, implying that this structural feature is inherent. Molecular
dynamics simulations also substantiate favorable self-assembly of compact
protein-micelle complexes with a more dynamic, solvent-exposed kink. Despite the 
observed similarity in TM segment behavior, micelle-dependent differences were
clear in the structure, dynamics, and compactness of the 30-residue,
extramembrane N-terminal tail of the protein. This would affect intermolecular
interactions and, correspondingly, the functional state of the membrane protein.

Interactions.

Bioactive apelin peptide forms ranging in length from 12 to 55 amino acids bind
to and activate the apelin receptor (AR or APJ), a class A G-protein coupled
receptor. Apelin-12, -17, and -36 isoforms, named according to length, with an
additional N-terminal cysteine residue allowed for regiospecific and efficient
conjugation of pyrene maleimide. Through steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, 
the emission properties of pyrene in aqueous buffer were compared to those of the
pyrene-apelin conjugates both without and with zwitterionic or anionic micelles. 
Pyrene photophysics are consistent with an expected partitioning into the
hydrophobic micellar cores, while pyrene-apelin conjugation prevented this
partitioning. Apelin, conversely, is expected to preferentially interact with
anionic micelles; pyrene-apelin conjugates appear to lose preferential
interaction. Finally, Förster resonance energy transfer between pyrene and
tryptophan residues in the N-terminal tail and first transmembrane segment (the
AR55 construct, comprising residues 1-55 of the AR) was consistent with efficient
nonspecific pyrene-apelin conjugate binding to micelles rather than direct,
specific apelin-AR55 binding. This approach provides a versatile fluorophore
conjugation strategy for apelin, particularly valuable given that even a highly
hydrophobic fluorophore is not deleterious to peptide behavior in
membrane-mimetic micellar systems.

Analogues of apelin-13 carrying diverse spacers and an ad hoc DY647-derived
fluorophore were designed and synthesized by chemoselective acylation of
α-hydrazinopeptides. The resulting probes retain very high affinity and efficacy 
for both the wild-type and SNAP-tagged apelin receptor (ApelinR). They give a
time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET) signal with rare-earth lanthanides used as donor
fluorophores grafted onto the SNAP-tagged receptor. This specific signal allowed 
the validation of a binding assay with a high signal-to-noise ratio. In such an
assay, the most potent sub-nanomolar fluorescent probe was found to be
competitively displaced by the endogenous apelin peptides with binding constants 
similar to those obtained in a classical radioligand assay. We have thus
validated the first TR-FRET cell-based binding assay for ApelinR with potential
high-throughput screening applications.

Aims: Elabela/Toddler/Apela (ELA) has been identified as a novel endogenous
peptide ligand for APJ/Apelin receptor/Aplnr. ELA plays a crucial role in early
cardiac development of zebrafish as well as in maintenance of self-renewal of
human embryonic stem cells. Apelin was the first identified APJ ligand, and
exerts positive inotropic heart effects and regulates the renin-angiotensin
system. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological effects of ELA in
the cardiovascular system.
Methods and results: Continuous infusion of ELA peptide significantly suppressed 
pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and impaired
contractility in mice. ELA treatment reduced mRNA expression levels of genes
associated with heart failure and fibrosis. The cardioprotective effects of ELA
were diminished in APJ knockout mice, indicating that APJ is the key receptor for
ELA in the adult heart. Mechanistically, ELA downregulated angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) expression in the stressed hearts, whereas it showed little effects 
on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, which are distinct from the
effects of Apelin. FoxM1 transcription factor, which induces ACE expression in
the stressed hearts, was downregulated by ELA but not by Apelin. ELA antagonized 
angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice.
Conclusion: The ELA-APJ axis protects from pressure overload-induced heart
failure possibly via suppression of ACE expression and pathogenic angiotensin II 
signalling. The different effects of ELA and Apelin on the expression of ACE and 
ACE2 implicate fine-tuned mechanisms for a ligand-induced APJ activation and
downstream signalling.

Biased agonists are defined by their ability to selectively activate distinct
signaling pathways of a receptor, and they hold enormous promise for the
development of novel drugs that specifically elicit only the desired therapeutic 
response and avoid potential adverse effects. Unfortunately, most high-throughput
screening (HTS) assays are designed to detect signaling of G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) downstream of either G protein or β-arrestin-mediated signaling
but not both. A comprehensive drug discovery program seeking biased agonists must
employ assays that report on the activity of each compound at multiple discrete
pathways, particularly for HTS campaigns. Here, we report a systematic approach
to the identification of biased agonists of human apelin receptor (APJ). We
synthesized 448 modified versions of apelin and screened them against a cascade
of cell-based assays, including intracellular cAMP and β-arrestin recruitment to 
APJ, simultaneously. The screen yielded potent and highly selective APJ agonists.
Representative hits displaying preferential signaling via either G-protein or
β-arrestin were subjected to a battery of confirmation assays. These biased
agonists will be useful as tools to probe the function and pharmacology of APJ
and provide proof of concept of our systematic approach to the discovery of
biased ligands. This approach is likely universally applicable to the search for 
biased agonists of GPCRs.

Aims: Apelin is a predicted substrate for ACE2, a novel therapeutic target. Our
aim was to demonstrate the endogenous presence of the putative ACE2 product
[Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) in human cardiovascular tissues and to confirm it retains
significant biological activity for the apelin receptor in vitro and in vivo. The
minimum active apelin fragment was also investigated. Methods and Results:
[Pyr1]apelin-13 incubated with recombinant human ACE2 resulted in de novo
generation of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) identified by mass spectrometry. Endogenous
[Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) was detected by immunostaining in human heart and lung
localized to the endothelium. Expression was undetectable in lung from patients
with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In human heart [Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) (pKi =
8.04 ± 0.06) and apelin-13(F13A) (pKi = 8.07 ± 0.24) competed with
[125I]apelin-13 binding with nanomolar affinity, 4-fold lower than for
[Pyr1]apelin-13 (pKi = 8.83 ± 0.06) whereas apelin-17 exhibited highest affinity 
(pKi = 9.63 ± 0.17). The rank order of potency of peptides to inhibit
forskolin-stimulated cAMP was apelin-17 (pD2 = 10.31 ± 0.28) > [Pyr1]apelin-13
(pD2 = 9.67 ± 0.04) ≥ apelin-13(F13A) (pD2 = 9.54 ± 0.05) > [Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12)
(pD2 = 9.30 ± 0.06). The truncated peptide apelin-13(R10M) retained nanomolar
potency (pD2 = 8.70 ± 0.04) but shorter fragments exhibited low micromolar
potency. In a β-arrestin recruitment assay the rank order of potency was
apelin-17 (pD2 = 10.26 ± 0.09) >> [Pyr1]apelin-13 (pD2 = 8.43 ± 0.08) >
apelin-13(R10M) (pD2 = 8.26 ± 0.17) > apelin-13(F13A) (pD2 = 7.98 ± 0.04) ≥
[Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) (pD2 = 7.84 ± 0.06) >> shorter fragments (pD2 < 6).
[Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) and apelin-13(F13A) contracted human saphenous vein with
similar sub-nanomolar potencies and [Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) was a potent inotrope
in paced mouse right ventricle and human atria. [Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) elicited a 
dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure in anesthetized rat and dose-dependent 
increase in forearm blood flow in human volunteers. Conclusions: We provide
evidence that ACE2 cleaves [Pyr1]apelin-13 to [Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) and this
cleavage product is expressed in human cardiovascular tissues. We have
demonstrated biological activity of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1-12) at the human and rodent
apelin receptor in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that reported enhanced ACE2
activity in cardiovascular disease should not significantly compromise the
beneficial effects of apelin based therapies for example in PAH.

KEY POINTS: Dysfunctions in CNS regulation of arterial blood pressure lead to an 
increase in sympathetic nerve activity that participates in the pathogenesis of
hypertension. The apelin-apelin receptor system affects arterial blood pressure
homeostasis; however, the central mechanisms underlying apelin-mediated changes
in sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure have not been clarified. We
explored the mechanisms involved in the regulation of [Pyr1 ]apelin-13-mediated
cardiovascular control within the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) using
selective receptor antagonists. We show that [Pyr1 ]apelin-13 acts as a
modulating neurotransmitter in the normotensive RVLM to affect vascular tone
through interaction with the vasopressin V1a receptor but that [Pyr1
]apelin-13-induced sympathoexcitation is independent of angiotensin II receptor
type 1, oxytocin, ionotropic glutamate and GABAA receptors. Our data confirm a
role for the apelin peptide system in cardiovascular regulation at the level of
the RVLM and highlight that this system is a possible potential therapeutic
target for the treatment of hypertension.
ABSTRACT: Apelin is a ubiquitous peptide that can elevate arterial blood pressure
(ABP) yet understanding of the mechanisms involved remain incomplete. Bilateral
microinjection of [Pyr1 ]apelin-13 into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM),
a major source of sympathoexcitatory neurones, increases ABP and sympathetic
nerve activity. We aimed to investigate the potential involvement of
neurotransmitter systems through which the apelin pressor response may occur
within the RVLM. Adult male Wistar rats were anaesthetized and ABP was monitored 
via a femoral arterial catheter. Bilateral RVLM microinjection of [Pyr1
]apelin-13 significantly increased ABP (9 ± 1 mmHg) compared to saline
(-1 ± 2mmHg; P < 0.001), which was blocked by pretreatment with the apelin
receptor antagonist, F13A (0 ± 1 mmHg; P < 0.01). The rise in ABP was associated 
with an increase in the low frequency spectra of systolic BP (13.9 ± 4.3% total
power; P < 0.001), indicative of sympathetic vasomotor activation. The [Pyr1
]apelin-13-mediated pressor response and the increased low frequency spectra of
systolic BP response were fully maintained despite RVLM pretreatment with the
angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, the oxytocin receptor
antagonist desGly-NH2 , d(CH2 )5 [D-Tyr2 ,Thr4 ]OVT, the ionotropic glutamate
receptor antagonist kynurenate or the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (P > 0.05). By
contrast, the [Pyr1 ]apelin-13 induced pressor and sympathoexcitatory effects
were abolished by pretreatment of the RVLM with the vasopressin V1a receptor
antagonist, SR 49059 (-1 ± 1 mmHg; 1.1 ± 1.1% total power, respectively;
P < 0.001). These findings suggest that the pressor action of [Pyr1 ]apelin-13 in
the RVLM of normotensive rats is not mediated via angiotensin II type 1 receptor,
oxytocin, ionotropic glutamate or GABAA receptors but instead involves a close
relationship with the neuropeptide modulator vasopressin.

APLN and its G-protein coupled receptor APLNR are expressed in the bovine ovary. 
However their role in granulosa cells and oocytes is unknown. Here, we studied
their expression in bovine ovarian cells and investigated their regulation in
cultured luteinizing granulosa cells in response to IGF1 and FSH. We determined
the effect and the molecular mechanism of APLN (isoforms 17 and 13) on bovine
granulosa cell progesterone secretion and on oocyte maturation. By RT-qPCR and
immunoblot, we showed that the expression of both APLN and APLNR in granulosa and
oocytes significantly increased with ovarian follicles size whereas it was
similar in theca interstitial cells. In vitro, in unstimulated luteinizing bovine
granulosa cells and in response to IGF1 (10-8 M) but not to FSH (10-8 M), we
observed that APLN (-17 and -13) (10-9 M) increased progesterone production; this
was abolished in response to the APLNR antagonist ML221. These latter effects
were dependent on the MAPK ERK1/2 kinase. Furthermore, we showed that APLN (-17
and -13) (10-9 M) increased cell proliferation through AKT signaling. Conversely,
the addition of APLN-13 and APLN-17 to in vitro maturation medium containing IGF1
(10-8 M) but not FSH (10-8 M) arrested most oocytes at the germinal vesicle
stage, which was associated with a decrease in progesterone secretion, an
inhibition in MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation and an increase in PRKA phosphorylation
in oocytes. Thus, APLN can increase progesterone secretion and cell proliferation
in bovine luteinizing granulosa cells in vitro, while it blocks meiotic
progression at the germinal vesicle stage during bovine oocyte in vitro
maturation.

Apelin signaling plays an important role during embryo development and regulates 
angiogenesis, cardiovascular activity, and energy metabolism in adulthood.
Overexpression and hyperactivity of this signaling pathway is observed in various
pathologic states, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer, which highlights
the importance of inhibiting apelin receptor (APJ); therefore, we developed a
cell-based screening assay that uses fluorescence microscopy to identify APJ
antagonists. This approach led us to identify the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration-approved compound protamine-already used clinically after cardiac 
surgery-as an agent to bind to heparin and thereby reverse its anticlotting
activity. Protamine displays a 390-nM affinity for APJ and behaves as a full
antagonist with regard to G protein and β-arrestin-dependent intracellular
signaling. Ex vivo and in vivo, protamine abolishes well-known apelin effects,
such as angiogenesis, glucose tolerance, and vasodilatation. Remarkably,
protamine antagonist activity is fully reversed by heparin treatment both in
vitro and in vivo Thus, our results demonstrate a new pharmacologic property of
protamine-blockade of APJ-that could explain some adverse effects observed in
protamine-treated patients. Moreover, our data reveal that the established
antiangiogenic activity of protamine would rely on APJ antagonism.-Le Gonidec,

The A445C Variant in Apelin Receptor and Diabetic Retinopathy in Tunisian
Patients.

Ben-Amor Z.

BACKGROUND: Apelin and apelin receptor (APLN/APLNR) are involved in the retinal
neovascularization of diabetic retinopathy (DR).
METHODS: This study investigated the impact of the APLNR A445C variant on the
risk of DR in a sample of the Tunisian population (100 patients with DR and 105
healthy controls) using PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: The genotype frequencies of the APLNR A445C variant were not
significantly different between the patient and control groups. The genotype was 
not associated with DR (OR = 1.49; 95% CI [0.49 - 4.48], p = 0.47 for the AC
heterozygous genotype and OR = 1.57; 95% CI [0.43 - 5.71], p = 0.49 for the CC
homozygous genotype). Furthermore, the clinical and biochemical parameters
according to the APLNR A445C genotypes revealed that only total cholesterol (TC) 
was significantly higher in the DR group with the CC genotype compared to the AA 
genotype (p < 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The APLNR A445C polymorphism was not associated with DR in a sample 
of the Tunisian population, but the CC genotype carrier patients with DR had a
high TC concentration.

BACKGROUND: Ischaemic heart disease is the main cause of mortality in the world. 
After myocardial infarction (MI) cardiomyocytes apoptosis and ventricular
remodelling have occurred. Apelin is a peptide that has been shown to exert
cardioprotective effects.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic and
anti-remodelling effects of [Pyr¹]apelin-13 in the rat model of post-MI.
METHODS: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1)
sham, (2) MI, and (3) MI treated with [Pyr¹] apelin-13 (MI+Apel). MI animals were
subjected to 30-min ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery
(LAD) and 14 days of reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after LAD ligation,
[Pyr¹]apelin-13 (10 nmol/kg/day, i.p.) was administered for five consecutive
days. Hypertrophic parameters, left ventricular (LV) remodelling, and gene
expression of Apel, apelin receptor (Apelr), Bax, caspase-3 (Casp-3), and Bcl-2
by real-time polymerase chain reaction and cardiomyocytes apoptosis by TUNEL
immunostaining were assessed on day 14 post-MI.
RESULTS: Post-infarct treatment with [Pyr¹]apelin-13 improved myocardial
hypertrophic and LV remodelling parameters and led to a significant increase in
the expression of Apel, Apelr, and Bcl-2, and a decrease in the expression of Bax
and Casp-3. Furthermore, treatment with [Pyr¹]apelin-13 decreased cardiomyocyte
apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: [Pyr¹]apelin-13 has anti-hypertrophic, anti-remodelling, and
anti-apoptotic effects via overexpression of Apel, Apelr, and Bcl-2 and reduces
gene expression of Bax and Casp-3 in the infarcted myocardium, which can in turn 
lead to repair myocardium.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, and
ischemic stroke accounts for approximately 87% of cases. Improving post-stroke
recovery is a major challenge in stroke treatment. Accumulated evidence indicates
that the apelinergic system, consisting of apelin and apelin receptor (APLNR), is
temporally dysregulated in ischemic stroke. Moreover, the apelinergic system
plays a pivotal role in post-stroke recovery by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and
facilitating angiogenesis through various molecular pathways. In this review
article, we summarize the temporal expression of apelin and APLNR in ischemic
stroke and the mechanisms of their dysregulation. In addition, the protective
role of the apelinergic system in ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanisms
of its protective effects are discussed. Furthermore, critical issues in
activating the apelinergic system as a potential therapy will also be discussed. 
The aim of this review article is to shed light on exploiting the activation of
the apelinergic system to treat ischemic stroke.

BACKGROUND: Elabela/toddler (ELA) is a critical cardiac developmental peptide
that acts through the G-protein-coupled apelin receptor, despite lack of sequence
similarity to the established ligand apelin. Our aim was to investigate the
receptor pharmacology, expression pattern, and in vivo function of ELA peptides
in the adult cardiovascular system, to seek evidence for alteration in pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) in which apelin signaling is downregulated, and to
demonstrate attenuation of PAH severity with exogenous administration of ELA in a
rat model.
METHODS: In silico docking analysis, competition binding experiments, and
downstream assays were used to characterize ELA receptor binding in human heart
and signaling in cells expressing the apelin receptor. ELA expression in human
cardiovascular tissues and plasma was determined using real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction, dual-labeling immunofluorescent staining, and
immunoassays. Acute cardiac effects of ELA-32 and [Pyr1]apelin-13 were assessed
by MRI and cardiac catheterization in anesthetized rats. Cardiopulmonary human
and rat tissues from PAH patients and monocrotaline- and Sugen/hypoxia-exposed
rats were used to show changes in ELA expression in PAH. The effect of ELA
treatment on cardiopulmonary remodeling in PAH was investigated in the
monocrotaline rat model.
RESULTS: ELA competed for binding of apelin in human heart with overlap for the 2
peptides indicated by in silico modeling. ELA activated G-protein- and
β-arrestin-dependent pathways. We detected ELA expression in human vascular
endothelium and plasma. Comparable to apelin, ELA increased cardiac
contractility, ejection fraction, and cardiac output and elicited vasodilatation 
in rat in vivo. ELA expression was reduced in cardiopulmonary tissues from PAH
patients and PAH rat models, respectively. ELA treatment significantly attenuated
elevation of right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular
hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling in monocrotaline-exposed rats.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ELA is an endogenous agonist of the human
apelin receptor, exhibits a cardiovascular profile comparable to apelin, and is
downregulated in human disease and rodent PAH models, and exogenous peptide can
reduce the severity of cardiopulmonary remodeling and function in PAH in rats.
This study provides additional proof of principle that an apelin receptor agonist
may be of therapeutic use in PAH in humans.

Apela (also referred to as ELABELA and toddler) is a peptide hormone that
activates the apelin receptor (AR or APJ) to regulate cardiovascular system
development and function. Here, we report the first biophysical characterization 
of three apela isoforms, apela-54, -32, and -11, alongside a monomeric
C1S-apela-11 mutant, using circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The behaviour of apela-54 is consistent
with a preprotein containing a hydrophobic, N-terminal signal peptide. The
potential for apela-membrane binding, leading to membrane catalyzed interactions 
with AR, was tested comprehensively for apela-32 and -11 in the presence of
membrane-mimetic dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and
1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (LPPG) micelles.
According to pulsed-field gradient diffusion NMR experiments, apela-32 interacts 
with all three micelles. Chemical shift perturbations indicate widespread
interactions along apela, with DPC and LPPG micelles inducing short segments with
α-helical character at distinct regions. Consistent with these data, ps-ns
dynamics along the peptide backbone appear decreased in the presence of micelles.
Apela-11 and C1S-apela-11, alternatively, interact preferentially with SDS and
LPPG micelles, promoting β-turn character observable by CD. Distinct differences 
in membrane-interaction propensity are therefore apparent both as a function of
apela isoform and of detergent headgroup. These results imply the potential for
cell membrane involvement in apela-AR recognition and binding, with the
implication that membrane catalysis has distinct functional and regulatory roles 
throughout the apelinergic system.

Epidemiological studies have reported that humans have detectable levels of not
only bisphenol A (BPA), but also its halogenated derivatives tetrabromobisphenol 
A (TBBPA) and tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA), in the serum. Our previous study
showed that BPA promotes ovarian cancer progression by directly inducing cell
proliferation and migration or by indirectly increasing leptin receptor
expression, which creates more binding sites for leptin. In this study, we
examined the expression of apelin and its receptor in non-cancer and cancer cell 
lines derived from the human ovary, and further explored whether the expression
of apelin and its receptor is modulated by BPA and its derivatives. We found that
the apelin receptor expression level was higher in epithelial cancer cells than
in granulosa tumour cells, whereas the reverse was true for apelin expression and
secretion. BPA, TBBPA and TCBPA at low nanomolar concentrations increased apelin 
expression and secretion in the epithelial ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3,
which involved the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ but not oestrogen
receptors. We also found evidence that secreted apelin acts as a mitogenic factor
in OVCAR-3 cells, and that BPA intensifies its activity. Taken together, our
results suggest that BPA and its derivatives induce ovarian cancer cell
progression by up-regulating apelin, which acts as a mitogenic factor in these
cells.

The apelin receptor (APJ) belongs to family A of the G protein-coupled receptors 
(GPCRs) and is a potential pharmacotherapeutic target for heart failure,
hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. There is evidence APJ
heterodimerizes with other GPCRs; however, the existence of APJ homodimers and
oligomers remains to be investigated. Here, we measured APJ
monomer-homodimer-oligomer interconversion by monitoring APJ dynamically on cells
and compared their proportions, spatial arrangement, and mobility using total
internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, resonance energy transfer, and
proximity biotinylation. In cells with <0.3 receptor particles/μm2, approximately
60% of APJ molecules were present as dimers or oligomers. APJ dimers were present
on the cell surface in a dynamic equilibrium with constant formation and
dissociation of receptor complexes. Furthermore, we applied interference peptides
and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to confirm APJ homo-dimer and explore the
dimer-interfaces. Peptides corresponding to transmembrane domain (TMD)1, 2, 3,
and 4, but not TMD5, 6, and 7, disrupted APJ dimerization. APJ mutants in TMD1
and TMD2 also decreased bioluminescence resonance energy transfer of APJ dimer.
APJ dimerization resulted in novel functional characteristics, such as a distinct
G-protein binding profile and cell responses after agonist stimulation. Thus,
dimerization may serve as a unique mechanism for fine-tuning APJ-mediated
functions.

Glutamate excitotoxicity mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is an 
important cause of retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma. To elucidate whether 
apelin protects against retinal neuronal cell death, we examined protective
effects of exogenous and endogenous apelin on neuronal cell death induced by
intravitreal injection of NMDA in the retinas of mice. An intravitreal injection 
of NMDA induced neuronal cell death in both the retinal ganglion cell layer and
inner nuclear layer, and reduced the amplitudes of scotopic threshold response
(STR) in electroretinography studies. Both cell death and STR amplitudes decrease
induced by NMDA were prevented by a co-injection of [Pyr1]-apelin-13, and were
facilitated by apelin deficiency. The neuroprotective effects of [Pyr1]-apelin-13
were blocked by an apelin receptor APJ antagonist, and by inhibitors of Akt and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways. Additionally, an
intravitreal injection of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) neutralizing antibody
prevented NMDA-induced retinal neuronal cell death, and exogenous and endogenous 
apelin suppressed NMDA-induced upregulation of TNF-α in the retina. These results
suggest that apelin protects neuronal cells against NMDA-induced death via an APJ
receptor in the retina, and that apelin may have beneficial effects in the
treatment of glaucoma.

Apelin is the endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor APJ and exerts
a key role in regulating cardiovascular functions. We report herein a novel
series of macrocyclic analogues of apelin-13 in which the N- and C-terminal
residues as well as the macrocycle composition were chemically modified to
modulate structure-activity relationships on the APJ receptor. To this end, the
binding affinity and the ability to engage G protein-dependent and G
protein-independent signalling pathways of the resulting analogues were assessed.
In this series, the position and the nature of the C-terminal aromatic residue is
a determinant for APJ interaction and β-arrestin recruitment, as previously
demonstrated for linear apelin-13 derivatives. We finally discovered compounds 1,
4, 11 and 15, four potent G protein-biased apelin receptor agonists exhibiting
affinity in the nanomolar range for APJ. These macrocyclic compounds represent
very useful pharmacological tools to explore the therapeutic potential of the
apelinergic system.

BACKGROUND: Elabela (ELA) is a recently identified apelin receptor agonist
essential for cardiac development, but its biology and therapeutic potential are 
unclear. In humans, ELA transcripts are detected in embryonic stem cells, induced
pluripotent stem cells, kidney, heart and blood vessels. ELA through the apelin
(APJ) receptor promotes angiogenesis in vitro, relaxes murine aortic blood
vessels and attenuates high blood pressure in vivo. The APJ receptor when bound
to its original ligand, apelin, exerts peripheral vasodilatory and positive
inotropic effects, conferring cardioprotection in vivo.
METHODS: This study initially assessed endogenous ELA expression in normal and
diseased rats and then characterized the effects of long-term ELA gene delivery
by adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors on cardiorenal function in
Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS) on a high-salt diet over 3 months.
RESULTS: Endogenous ELA was predominantly expressed in the kidneys, especially in
the renal collecting duct cells and was not affected by disease. Rat ELA was
overexpressed in the heart via AAV9 vector by a single intravenous injection.
ELA-treated animals showed delayed onset of blood pressure elevation. Prior to
high-salt diet, a reduction in the fractional sodium and chloride excretion was
observed in rats given the AAV9-ELA vector. After three months on a high-salt
diet, ELA preserved glomerular architecture, decreased renal fibrosis and
suppressed expression of fibrosis-associated genes in the kidneys.
CONCLUSION: ELA is constitutively expressed in renal collecting ducts in rats.
Sustained AAV-ELA expression may offer a potential long-term therapy for
hypertension and renal remodeling.

PURPOSE: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignancy of the biliary epithelium that 
is associated with low five-year survival. The apelin receptor (APLNR), which is 
activated by the apelin peptide, has not been studied in CCA. The purpose of this
study is to determine if inhibition of the apelin/APLNR axis can inhibit CCA
growth.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, rtPCR, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and
ELISA was used to measure APLNR expression in human CCA cells and tissues.
Mz-ChA-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of apelin and ML221,
an APLNR antagonist. Expression of proliferative and angiogenic genes were
measured via rtPCR. In vivo, Mz-ChA-1 cells were injected into the flanks of
nu/nu mice, which were treated with ML221 (150 μg/kg) via tail vein injection.
RESULTS: Expression of the apelin/APLNR axis was increased in CCA. In vitro, CCA 
proliferation and angiogenesis was inhibited by ML221 treatment. ML221 treatment 
significantly decreased tumor growth in nu/nu mice.
CONCLUSION: The apelin/APLNR axis regulates CCA proliferation and angiogenesis.
Inhibition of the apelin/APLNR axis decreases tumor growth in our xenograft
model. Targeting APLNR signaling has the potential to serve as a novel, tumor
directed therapy for CCA.

The apelin/apelin receptor system is widely distributed and has a dominant role
in cardiovascular homeostasis and disease. The apelin gene is X-linked and is
synthesized as a 77 amino acid pre-pro-peptide that is subsequently cleaved to
generate a family of apelin peptides that possess similar functions but display
different tissue distribution, potency and receptor binding affinity.
Loss-of-function experiments using the apelin and the apelin receptor knockout
mice and gain-of-function experiments using apelin peptides have delineated a
well-defined role of the apelin axis in cardiovascular physiology and diseases.
Activation of the apelin receptor by its cognate peptide ligand, apelin, induces 
a wide range of physiological effects, including vasodilation, increased
myocardial contractility, angiogenesis, and balanced energy metabolism and fluid 
homeostasis. The apelin/apelin receptor pathway is also implicated in
atherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes
and obesity, making it a promising therapeutic target. Hence, research is
expanding to develop novel therapies that inhibit degradation of endogenous
apelin peptides or their analogues. Chemical synthesis of stable apelin receptor 
agonists aims to more efficiently enhance the activation of the apelin system.
Targeting the apelin/apelin receptor axis has emerged as a novel therapeutic
approach against cardiovascular diseases and an increased understanding of
cardiovascular actions of the apelin system will help to develop effective
interventions.

Apelin, a (neuro)vasoactive peptide, plays a prominent role in controlling
cardiovascular functions and water balance. Because the in vivo apelin half-life 
is in the minute range, we aimed to identify metabolically stable apelin-17
(K17F) analogs. We generated P92 by classic chemical substitutions and LIT01-196 
by original addition of a fluorocarbon chain to the N terminus of K17F. Both
analogs were much more stable in plasma (half-life >24 h for LIT01-196) than K17F
(4.6 min). Analogs displayed a subnanomolar affinity for the apelin receptor and 
behaved as full agonists with regard to cAMP production, ERK phosphorylation, and
apelin receptor internalization. Ex vivo, these compounds induced vasorelaxation 
of rat aortas and glomerular arterioles, respectively, precontracted with
norepinephrine and angiotensin II, and increased cardiac contractility. In vivo, 
after intracerebroventricular administration in water-deprived mice, P92 and
LIT01-196 were 6 and 160 times, respectively, more efficient at inhibiting
systemic vasopressin release than K17F. Administered intravenously (nmol/kg
range) in normotensive rats, these analogs potently increased urine output and
induced a profound and sustained decrease in arterial blood pressure. In summary,
these new compounds, which favor diuresis and improve cardiac contractility while
reducing vascular resistances, represent promising candidates for the treatment
of heart failure and water retention/hyponatremic disorders.-Gerbier, R.,

Wnt signaling plays essential roles in both embryonic pattern formation and
postembryonic tissue homoestasis. High levels of Wnt activity repress foregut
identity and facilitate hindgut fate through forming a gradient of Wnt signaling 
activity along the anterior-posterior axis. Here, we examined the mechanisms of
Wnt signaling in hindgut development by differentiating human embryonic stem
cells (hESCs) into the hindgut progenitors. We observed severe morphological
changes when Wnt signaling was blocked by using Wnt antagonist Dkk1. We performed
deep-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and identified 240 Wnt-activated genes
and 2023 Wnt-repressed genes, respectively. Clusters of Wnt targets showed
enrichment in specific biological functions, such as "gastrointestinal or
skeletal development" in the Wnt-activated targets and "neural or immune system
development" in the Wnt-repressed targets. Moreover, we adopted a high-throughput
chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) approach to identify
the genomic regions through which Wnt-activated transcription factor TCF7L2
regulated transcription. We identified 83 Wnt direct target candidates, including
the hindgut marker CDX2 and the genes relevant to morphogenesis (MSX1, MSX2,
LEF1, T, PDGFRB etc.) through combinatorial analysis of the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq 
data. Together, our study identified a series of direct and indirect Wnt targets 
in hindgut differentiation, and uncovered the diverse mechanisms of Wnt signaling
in regulating multi-lineage differentiation.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder with no effective treatment or cure.
Neuropeptide apelin is an endogenous ligand of angiotensin receptor-like 1 (APJ).
It has been shown that apelin has protective and anti-neurodegenerative
properties. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of apelin-13 on
pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced rat model of seizure. Adult male Wistar rats
were divided into the experimental groups as follows: control group receiving
PTZ; apelin-treated group which received apelin-13 before PTZ;
apelin+F13A-treated group which received apelin-13 plus the apelin receptor
antagonist (F13A) before PTZ; apelin+naloxone group which received
apelin-13+naloxone before PTZ. Behavioral scoring was used to access seizure. The
expression level of APJ was measured by western blotting. Neuronal degeneration, 
apoptosis and astrocyte activation were evaluated by vanadium acid fuchsin (VAF) 
staining and immunohistochemistry. Our data demonstrated that apelin-13
pretreatment significantly inhibited seizure threshold (p<0.001) and tonic-clonic
latency (p<0.001) compared with the control group. In addition, PTZ-induced
up-regulation of APJ was attenuated by apelin-13 treatment. Histological and
immunohistochemical findings also showed that apelin-13 could protect cortical
neurons against PTZ-induced neuroinflammation and apoptosis. In conclusion,
apelin-13 has anticonvulsive and neuroprotective properties against PTZ-induced
seizure in rats and provided a new pharmacological aspect of the neuropeptide
apelin.

Retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma is caused at least in part by a large
Ca2+ influx through N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. Apelin is a
peptide originally found in the tissue extracts of bovine stomach. Recent studies
have been shown that apelin protects against the ischemic-reperfused injury in
the brain. We examined whether apelin had protective effects on the NMDA-induced 
retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death using B6.Cg-TgN(Thy1-CFP)23Jrs/J transgenic
mice, which express the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein in RGCs in the retina, 
in vivo. The mice were anesthetized by ketamine and xylazine, and NMDA (40
nmol/eye) was intravitreally injected. We evaluated the effects of apelin-13,
[Glp1]-apelin-13, a potent agonist of apelin receptor, and apelin-36 on the
NMDA-induced retinal ganglion cell death. NMDA-induced retinal ganglion cell loss
was clearly seen 7 days after NMDA injection. Intravitreal apelin-36 (0.33
nmol/eye), but not apelin-13 (1 nmol/eye) nor [Glp1]-apelin-13 (1 nmol/eye),
simultaneously injected with NMDA significantly reduced the cell loss. The
protective effect of apelin-36 was not reduced by ML221 (0.1 nmol/eye;
5-[(4-Nitrobenzoyl)oxy]-2-[(2-pyrimidinylthio)methyl]-4H-pyran-4-one), an apelin 
receptor antagonist, GF109203X (0.03 nmol/eye), a protein kinase C inhibitor,
U0126 (0.2 nmol/eye), a MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (0.1 nmol/eye), a
phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, Akti 1/2 (0.05 nmol/eye), an Akt inhibitor, 
or 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (0.2 nmol/eye), a casein kinase-2 inhibitor.
In addition, human apelin-36 did not affect the kainic-acid (20 nmol/eye)-induced
ganglion cell death. The present study suggests that apelin-36 protects against
the NMDA-induced ganglion cell death independently of the activation of apelin
receptor in the murine retina in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Apelin, the endogenous ligand of orphan receptor APJ (gene symbol
APLNR), is an adipokine that was suggested to have a direct correlation with
obesity. This peptide might play a role in obesity-related disorders, especially 
in the cardiovascular system. Currently, few data are available on levels and
potential metabolic functions of apelin in different cardiac diseases including
atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), which have common
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate apelin 
levels in patients with AF and CAD that were overweight or obese, as well as its 
relationship with anthropometry and metabolic profile.
METHODS: This preliminary investigation was compromised of 41 patients with AF
and 39 with CAD aged > 50 years and body mass index (BMI) > 25kg/m2. Serum levels
of apelin, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment,
triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and very-low-density lipoprotein were
measured.
RESULTS: The apelin serum levels were not statistically different between
patients with AF and CAD. A negative correlation was observed between apelin with
weight (r = -0.257, P = 0.023) and BMI (r = -0.258, P = 0.023). Moreover, apelin 
showed an inverse correlation with insulin (r =-0.227, P = 0.045) and marginally 
with homeostatic model assessment (r = -0.21, P = 0.066). There was a negative
association between apelin and triglyceride (r = -0.238, P = 0.036) and
very-low-density lipoprotein (r = -0.25, P = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: Apelin serum levels were not significantly different among patients 
with AF and CAD. The unexpected inverse correlation of apelin with weight and BMI
might indicate the dominant effects of pathophysiological conditions such as AF
and CAD on serum levels of apelin compared with BMI and adipose tissue.
Understanding the precise role of apelin in modulating obesity-induced disorders 
including AF and CAD requires further studies.

Influences of adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) activity on the cardiac transcriptome 
and genesis of endotoxemic myocarditis are unclear. We applied transcriptomic
profiling (39 K Affymetrix arrays) to identify A2AR-sensitive molecules, revealed
by receptor knockout (KO), in healthy and endotoxemic hearts. Baseline cardiac
function was unaltered and only 37 A2AR-sensitive genes modified by A2AR KO
(≥1.2-fold change, <5 % FDR); the five most induced are Mtr, Ppbp, Chac1, Ctsk
and Cnpy2 and the five most repressed are Hp, Yipf4, Acta1, Cidec and Map3k2. Few
canonical paths were impacted, with altered Gnb1, Prkar2b, Pde3b and Map3k2
(among others) implicating modified G protein/cAMP/PKA and cGMP/NOS signalling.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 mg/kg) challenge for 24 h modified >4100 transcripts 
in wild-type (WT) myocardium (≥1.5-fold change, FDR < 1 %); the most induced are 
Lcn2 (+590); Saa3 (+516); Serpina3n (+122); Cxcl9 (+101) and Cxcl1 (+89) and the 
most repressed are Car3 (-38); Adipoq (-17); Atgrl1/Aplnr (-14); H19 (-11) and
Itga8 (-8). Canonical responses centred on inflammation, immunity, cell death and
remodelling, with pronounced amplification of toll-like receptor (TLR) and
underlying JAK-STAT, NFκB and MAPK pathways, and a 'cardio-depressant' profile
encompassing suppressed ß-adrenergic, PKA and Ca2+ signalling, electromechanical 
and mitochondrial function (and major shifts in transcripts impacting
function/injury including Lcn2, S100a8/S100a9, Icam1/Vcam and Nox2 induction, and
Adipoq, Igf1 and Aplnr repression). Endotoxemic responses were selectively
modified by A2AR KO, supporting inflammatory suppression via A2AR sensitive
shifts in regulators of NFκB and JAK-STAT signalling (IκBζ, IκBα, STAT1, CDKN1a
and RRAS2) without impacting the cardio-depressant gene profile. Data indicate
A2ARs exert minor effects in un-stressed myocardium and selectively suppress NFκB
and JAK-STAT signalling and cardiac injury without influencing cardiac depression
in endotoxemia.

Apelin is an endogenous ligand for apelin receptor (APJ) with analgesic effect on
visceral, analgesic and proanalgesic influences on acute pains in animal models. 
The purpose of this study was to determine the possible analgesic effects of
[Pyr1] apelin-13 on chronic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Animals 
were randomly divided into three major groups as intact, sham and SCI. The SCI
group randomly allocated to four subgroups as no treatment, vehicle-treatment
(normal saline: 10μl, intrathecally) and two subgroups with intrathecal injection
(i.t) of 1μg and 5μg of [Pyr1] apelin-13. After laminectomy at T6-T8 level,
spinal cord compression injury was induced using an aneurysm clip. Vehicle or
[Pyr1] apelin-13 injected from day1 post SCI and continued for a week on a daily 
basis. Pain behaviors and locomotor activity were monitored up to 8weeks. At the 
end of the experiments, intracardial paraformaldehyde perfusion was made under
deep anesthesia in some animals for histological and immunohistochemistry
evaluations. Western blot technique was also done to detect caspase-3 in fresh
spinal cord tissues. SCI decreased nociceptive thresholds and locomotor scores.
Administration of [Pyr1] apelin-13 (1μg and 5μg) improved locomotor activity and 
reduced pain symptoms, cavity size and caspase-3 levels. Results showed long-term
beneficial effects of [Pyr1] apelin-13 on neuropathic pain and locomotion.
Therefore, we may suggest [Pyr1] apelin-13 as a new option for further
neuropathic pain research and a suitable candidate for ensuing clinical trials in
spinal cord injury arena.

Formation of the three embryonic germ layers is a fundamental developmental
process that initiates differentiation. How the zebrafish pluripotency factor
Pou5f3 (homologous to mammalian Oct4) drives lineage commitment is unclear. Here,
we introduce fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy to assess the formation of Pou5f3 complexes with other
transcription factors in real-time in gastrulating zebrafish embryos. We show, at
single-cell resolution in vivo, that Pou5f3 complexes with Nanog to pattern
mesendoderm differentiation at the blastula stage. Later, during gastrulation,
Sox32 restricts Pou5f3-Nanog complexes to the ventrolateral mesendoderm by
binding Pou5f3 or Nanog in prospective dorsal endoderm. In the ventrolateral
endoderm, the Elabela / Aplnr pathway limits Sox32 levels, allowing the formation
of Pou5f3-Nanog complexes and the activation of downstream BMP signaling. This
quantitative model shows that a balance in the spatiotemporal distribution of
Pou5f3-Nanog complexes, modulated by Sox32, regulates mesendoderm specification
along the dorsoventral axis.

Apelin (APLN) is a recently discovered adipokine involved in the regulation of
various metabolic functions. Its receptor, APLNR, is expressed in reproductive
tissues, however, its role in human ovarian cells is unknown. In this study, we
identified APLN and APLNR in human ovarian follicles and analyzed their
expression in granulosa cells and follicular fluid obtained from obese and
nonobese patients, with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We also
investigated the effect of APLN on steroidogenesis in cultured human luteinized
granulosa cells (hGCs) from nonobese patients without PCOS. Using RT-PCR and
immunoblotting, we found that APLN and APLNR were expressed in hGCs and cumulus
and theca cells. We confirmed these data immunohistochemically and observed that 
APLNR and APLN are present in human oocytes at different stages of follicular
development. In patients with PCOS, we observed that follicular fluid APLN
concentration and granulosa cell APLN and APLNR mRNA expression was higher than
that observed in control patients. In cultured hGCs from nonobese patients
without PCOS, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) increased APLNR expression, and
recombinant human APLN (APLN-13 and APLN-17) increased both basal and
IGF1-induced steroid secretion. These effects on steroid production were reversed
when cultured in the presence of ML221, an APLNR antagonist, which was associated
with an increased 3beta-hydrosteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B) protein concentration.
We showed that these effects were dependent on the activation of the AKT and
MAPK3/1 pathways using pharmacological inhibitors. Our results show that APLN and
APLNR are present in human ovarian cells and APLN increases IGF1-induced
steroidogenesis in granulosa cells through an increase in HSD3B protein
expression and activation of the MAPK3/1 and Akt pathways. Therefore, APLN and
APLNR may play a role in human follicular development and the pathogenesis of
PCOS.

Pain represents a major contributing factor to the individual's quality of life. 
Although pain killers as opioids, endogenous or exogenous peptides can decrease
pain perception, the chronic use of them leads to antinociceptive tolerance. It
has been demonstrated that neuropeptide apelin has potent antinoceptive effect.
However, the possibility of the induction of its antinociceptive tolerance has
not yet been clarified. The tail-flick test was used to assess the nociceptive
threshold. All experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats which received
intrathecal apelin for 7days. To determine the role of apelin and opioid
receptors on the development of apelin analgesic tolerance, their receptor
antagonists (F-13 A and naloxone, respectively) were injected simultaneously with
apelin. The lumbar spinal cord was assayed to determine apelin receptor levels by
the western blotting method. Plasma corticosterone levels were assayed using
ELISA. Results showed that apelin (3μg/rat) induced strong thermal
antinociception. In addition, chronic apelin produced tolerance to its
antinociceptive effect and down regulated spinal apelin receptor. F-13 A and
naloxone could inhibit apelin tolerance development. The corticosterone levels
did not change following drug administration. Taken together, the data indicated 
that apelin like other analgesic drugs leads to the induction of side effects
such as analgesic tolerance which is mediated partly via the apelin and opioid
receptors activation.

Apelin acts via the G protein-coupled apelin receptor (APJ) to mediate effects on
cardiovascular and fluid homeostasis. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
trafficking has an important role in the regulation of receptor signalling
pathways and cellular functions, however in the case of APJ the mechanisms and
proteins involved in apelin-induced trafficking are not well understood. We
generated a stable HEK-293 cell line expressing N-terminus HA-tagged mouse (m)
APJ, and used a semi-automated imaging protocol to quantitate APJ trafficking and
ERK1/2 activation following stimulation with [Pyr1]apelin-13. The mechanisms of
[Pyr1]apelin-13-induced internalization and desensitization were explored using
dominant-negative mutant (DNM) cDNA constructs of G protein-coupled receptor
kinase 2 (GRK2), β-arrestin1, EPS15 and dynamin. The di-phosphorylated ERK1/2
(ppERK1/2) response to [Pyr1]apelin-13 desensitized during sustained stimulation,
due to upstream APJ-specific adaptive changes. Furthermore, [Pyr1]apelin-13
stimulation caused internalization of mAPJ via clathrin coated vesicles (CCVs)
and also caused a rapid reduction in cell surface and whole cell HA-mAPJ. Our
data suggest that upon continuous agonist exposure GRK2-mediated phosphorylation 
targets APJ to CCVs that are internalized from the cell surface in a
β-arrestin1-independent, EPS15- and dynamin-dependent manner. Internalization
does not appear to contribute to the desensitization of APJ-mediated ppERK1/2
activation in these cells.

Apelin peptide analogues displaying bias towards G protein signalling pathways
have beneficial cardiovascular actions compared with the native peptide in humans
in vivo. Our aim was to determine whether small molecule agonists could retain G 
protein bias. We have identified a biased small molecule, CMF-019, and
characterised it in vitro and in vivo. In competition radioligand binding
experiments in heart homogenates, CMF-019 bound to the human, rat and mouse
apelin receptor with high affinity (pKi=8.58±0.04, 8.49±0.04 and 8.71±0.06
respectively). In cell-based functional assays, whereas, CMF-019 showed similar
potency for the Gαi pathway to the endogenous agonist [Pyr(1)]apelin-13
(pD2=10.00±0.13 vs 9.34±0.15), in β-arrestin and internalisation assays it was
less potent (pD2=6.65±0.15 vs 8.65±0.10 and pD2=6.16±0.21 vs 9.28±0.10
respectively). Analysis of these data demonstrated a bias of ∼400 for the Gαi
over the β-arrestin pathway and ∼6000 over receptor internalisation. CMF-019 was 
tested for in vivo activity using intravenous injections into anaesthetised male 
Sprague-Dawley rats fitted with a pressure-volume catheter in the left ventricle.
CMF-019 caused a significant increase in cardiac contractility of 606±112mmHg/s
(p<0.001) at 500nmol. CMF-019 is the first biased small molecule identified at
the apelin receptor and increases cardiac contractility in vivo. We have
demonstrated that Gαi over β-arrestin/internalisation bias can be retained in a
non-peptide analogue and predict that such bias will have the therapeutic benefit
following chronic use. CMF-019 is suitable as a tool compound and provides the
basis for design of biased agonists with improved pharmacokinetics for treatment 
of cardiovascular conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if polymorphisms of APLN and APLNR genes
may play a role as susceptibility markers for hypertension in a group of
Mexican-Mestizo patients. A case-control study was carried out including
normotensive and hypertensive individuals. For these, two polymorphisms of APLN
(rs3761581 and rs56204867) and two of APLNR () genes were genotyped by 5'
exonuclease TaqMan assay in 400 normotensive individuals and 383 patients. The
results showed that, under an additive model adjusted by BMI, HDL, triglycerides,
glucose and family history of essential hypertension, the rs7119375 and
rs10501367 polymorphisms of APLNR gene were associated significantly with a
decreased risk of essential hypertension (P=0.039 and P=0.029, respectively).
Besides, the haplotypes analysis of these polymorphisms showed that H1 haplotype 
was associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension (P=0.026), while 
the H2 haplotype was associated with a decreased risk (P=0.032). Contrary, the
rs3761581 and rs56204867 polymorphisms of APLN gene were not associated with
essential hypertension (P=0.1707 and P=0.0769, respectively). The data suggest
that APLNR rs7119375 and rs10501367 are associated with a decreased risk of
essential hypertension in our Mexican-Mestizo studied group, but further studies 
are warranted.

Based on the available literature, it can be assumed that in cases of
post-infarct heart failure (HF) and obesity, a significant change in the central 
regulation of the cardiovascular system takes place with, among others, the
involvement of the apelinergic system. The main objective of the present study
was to clarify the role of apelin-13 in the central regulation of the
cardiovascular system in Sprague Dawley rats with HF or sham operated (SO) and
fed on a normal fat (NFD) or a high fat diet (HFD). The study was divided into
two parts: Part I, hemodynamic studies; and Part II, biochemical and molecular
studies. The animals were subjected to the following research procedures. Part I 
and II: feeding NFD or HFD; experimental induction of HF or SO; Part I:
intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of the examined substances, monitoring of 
mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (HR); Part II: venous blood
and tissue samples collected. ICV infusion of apelin-13 caused significantly
higher changes in ΔMABP in the SO NFD group. No changes were noted in ΔHR in any 
of the studied groups. Apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) mRNA expression in the
brain and adipose tissues was higher in the HF rats. HFD causes significant
increase in expression of apelin and APJ mRNA in the left ventricle. In
conclusion, HF and HFD appear to play an important role in modifying the activity
of the central apelinergic system and significant changes in mRNA expression of
apelin and APJ receptor.

The apelinergic system is a mammalian peptide hormone network with key
physiological roles. Apelin isoforms and analogues are believed to be promising
therapeutics for cardiovascular disease. Despite extensive studies on apelin-13
degradation patterns, only one protease, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), 
had been implicated in its physiological regulation. Through use of a
peptide-based fluorescent probe, we identified the metalloprotease neprilysin
(NEP, a target for Entresto used in treatment of heart failure) as an enzyme that
cleaves apelin isoforms. In vitro NEP proteolysis generated fragments that lacked
the ability to bind to the apelin receptor, thereby making NEP the first protease
to fully inactivate apelin. The involvement of NEP in the apelinergic system
contributes to the understanding of its role in cardiovascular physiology.

The objective of this study was to explore the role of apelin in the healing of
gastric lesions induced by stress. Male Wistar rats were exposed to water
immersion and restraint stress (WIRS) for 6 h with or without the apelin receptor
antagonist F13A. The rats were killed on the 1st, 3rd, 5th or 10th day after the 
end of stress induction. Apelin and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression was
increased on the 1st day after the end of stress exposure and was decreased daily
thereafter. However, F13A retarded the healing of gastric lesions by preventing
the improvement of mucosal blood flow, prostaglandin E2 production and vascular
endothelial growth factor expression in rats exposed to WIRS. Additionally, F13A 
increased the gastric 4-hydroxynonenol + malondialdehyde content on the 1st and
3rd days after the end of stress induction but did not affect the change in
gastric mucosal nitric oxide levels. In conclusion, apelin may be a regulatory
protein involved in the healing mechanism of stress-induced gastric damage.

The apelinergic system includes a series of endogenous peptides apelin,
ELABELA/TODDLER and their 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled apelin receptor (APJ,
AGTRL-1, APLNR). The APJ receptor is an attractive therapeutic target because of 
its involvement in cardiovascular diseases and potentially other disorders
including liver fibrosis, obesity, diabetes, and neuroprotection. To date,
pharmacological characterization of the APJ receptor has been limited due to the 
lack of small molecule functional agonists or antagonists. Through focused
screening we identified a drug-like small molecule agonist hit 1 with a
functional EC50 value of 21.5±5μM and binding affinity (Ki) of 5.2±0.5μM. Initial
structure-activity studies afforded compound 22 having a 27-fold enhancement in
potency and the first sub-micromolar full agonist with an EC50 value of 800±0.1nM
and Ki of 1.3±0.3μM. Preliminary SAR, synthetic methodology, and in vitro
pharmacological characterization indicate this scaffold will serve as a favorable
starting point for further refinement of APJ potency and selectivity.

The aim of this study was to assess the associations between single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) of the apelin and APJ (apelin receptor) genes and the risk
of hypertension in people living in the south-east coastal area of China. A
cross-sectional study involving 1031 participants was performed. Genotypes of the
apelin (rs3115757, rs56204867 and rs3761581) and APJ (rs7119375 and rs9943582)
genes were determined by the TaqMan® MGB probe method. For male patients, the
frequencies of mutant alleles in the three apelin gene SNPs were significantly
different between the hypertension and control groups (all p < 0.05), while no
significant difference was obtained for frequencies of mutant alleles in the two 
APJ gene SNPs (p > 0.05). For females, the frequencies of mutant alleles in all
five SNPs were not significantly different between the hypertension and control
groups (all p > 0.05). After adjusting for several factors, the risk of
developing hypertension increased significantly in patients, regardless of
gender, carrying rs3115757-C, rs56204867-C or rs3761581-A allele (all p < 0.05). 
The optimal gene-gene interaction model for both males and females with regard to
hypertension was apelin rs3761581-apelin rs3115757-APJ rs7119375. In conclusion, 
gene polymorphisms of the apelin-APJ system are associated with susceptibility to
hypertension.

AIM: Vasopressin exerts robust influences on social communication and behavior in
humans. Apelin is a relatively novel neuropeptide that could counteract
vasopressin's actions and has been shown to be closely related with a broad range
of physiological functions. Abnormalities in vasopressin and apelin have been
detected in a variety of psychiatric disorders, but their relation to
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is unknown. In the present study,
we explored the plasma levels of vasopressin and apelin-13 in children with ADHD.
METHODS: Thirty-four children with ADHD and 36 healthy controls were enrolled in 
this study. The severity of ADHD symptoms was assessed via Conners' Parent Rating
Scale and Conners' Teacher Rating Scale. Plasma levels of vasopressin and
apelin-13 were measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.
RESULTS: The mean plasma apelin-13 levels were significantly higher in male
children with ADHD than in male control subjects; no significant difference was
found between the groups for plasma apelin-13 levels in girls or in the entire
subject cohort. Plasma vasopressin levels did not show any significant
differences between groups. There were no significant correlations between plasma
levels of these neuropeptides and scores for Conners' Parent Rating Scale and
Conners' Teacher Rating Scale.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a sex-specific association between plasma
apelin-13 levels and ADHD. Apelin-13 may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of
ADHD either with a direct impact on the apelin receptor or via its opposing
effect on the vasopressinergic system.

Endothelial cells (ECs) respond to shear stress by aligning in the direction of
flow. However, how ECs respond to flow in complex in vivo environments is less
clear. Here we describe an endothelial-specific transgenic zebrafish line,
whereby the Golgi apparatus is labelled to allow for in vivo analysis of
endothelial polarization. We find that most ECs polarize within 4.5 h after the
onset of vigorous blood flow and, by manipulating cardiac function, observe that 
flow-induced EC polarization is a dynamic and reversible process. Based on its
role in EC migration, we analyse the role of Apelin signalling in EC polarization
and find that it is critical for this process. Knocking down Apelin receptor
function in human primary ECs also affects their polarization. Our study provides
new tools to analyse the mechanisms of EC polarization in vivo and reveals an
important role in this process for a signalling pathway implicated in
cardiovascular disease.

Apelin is an endogenous ligand of the apelin receptor (APJ), a
seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. Apelin/APJ system has a wide
tissue distribution in the brain as well as in peripheral organs including heart,
lung, vessels, and adipose tissue. Apelin/APJ was involved in regulating cardiac 
and vascular function, heart development, and vascular smooth muscle cell
proliferation. In this article, we summarize the role of apelin/APJ system on
lung cancer, gastroesophageal and colonic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma,
prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, brain cancer, 
and tumor neoangiogenesis. Apelin/APJ may be a potential anticancer therapeutic
target.

The Apelin receptor (Aplnr) is essential for heart development, controlling the
early migration of cardiac progenitors. Here we demonstrate that in zebrafish
Aplnr modulates Nodal/TGFβ signaling, a key pathway essential for mesendoderm
induction and migration. Loss of Aplnr function leads to a reduction in Nodal
target gene expression whereas activation of Aplnr by a non-peptide agonist
increases the expression of these same targets. Furthermore, loss of Aplnr
results in a delay in the expression of the cardiogenic transcription factors
mespaa/ab. Elevating Nodal levels in aplnra/b morphant and double mutant embryos 
is sufficient to rescue cardiac differentiation defects. We demonstrate that loss
of Aplnr attenuates the activity of a point source of Nodal ligands Squint and
Cyclops in a non-cell autonomous manner. Our results favour a model in which
Aplnr is required to fine-tune Nodal output, acting as a specific rheostat for
the Nodal/TGFβ pathway during the earliest stages of cardiogenesis.

G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling, including that involving apelin
(APLN) and its receptor APLNR, is known to be important in vascular development. 
How this ligand-receptor pair regulates the downstream signalling cascades in
this context remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mice with Apln, Aplnr 
or endothelial-specific Aplnr deletion develop profound retinal vascular defects,
which are at least in part due to dysregulated increase in endothelial CXCR4
expression. Endothelial CXCR4 is negatively regulated by miR-139-5p, whose
transcription is in turn induced by laminar flow and APLN/APLNR signalling.
Inhibition of miR-139-5p in vivo partially phenocopies the retinal vascular
defects of APLN/APLNR deficiency. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR4 signalling 
or augmentation of the miR-139-5p-CXCR4 axis can ameliorate the vascular
phenotype of APLN/APLNR deficient state. Overall, we identify an important
microRNA-mediated GPCR crosstalk, which plays a key role in vascular development.

The G protein-coupled receptor APJ and its ligand apelin are highly expressed in 
cardiovascular tissues and are associated with the regulation of blood pressure
and cardiac function. Although accumulating evidence suggests that APJ plays a
crucial role in the heart, it remains unclear whether up-regulation of APJ
affects cardiac function. Here we generated cardiomyocyte-specific
APJ-overexpressing (APJ-TG) mice and investigated the cardiac phenotype in APJ-TG
mice. Male and non-pregnant APJ-TG mice showed cardiac hypertrophy, contractile
dysfunction, and elevation of B-type natriuretic peptide gene expression in the
heart but not cardiac fibrosis and symptoms of heart failure, including breathing
abnormality and pleural effusion. We further examined the influence of APJ
overexpression in response to physiological stress induced by pregnancy and
lactation in the heart. Interestingly, repeating pregnancy and lactation
(pregnancy-lactation cycle) exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and systolic
dysfunction and induced cardiac fibrosis, lung congestion, pleural effusion, and 
abnormal breathing in APJ-TG mice. These data indicate that female APJ-TG mice
develop postpartum cardiomyopathy. We showed that lactation, but not parturition,
was critical for the onset of postpartum cardiomyopathy in APJ-TG mice.
Furthermore, we found that lactating APJ-TG mice showed impaired myocardial
angiogenesis and imbalance of pro- and antiangiogenic gene expression in the
heart. These results demonstrate that overexpression of APJ in cardiomyocytes has
adverse effects on cardiac function in male and non-pregnant mice and that
lactation contributes to the development of postpartum cardiomyopathy in the
heart with APJ overexpression.

ELABELA (ELA) was recently discovered as a novel endogenous ligand of the apelin 
receptor (APJ), a G protein-coupled receptor. ELA signaling was demonstrated to
be crucial for normal heart and vasculature development during embryogenesis. We 
delineate here ELA's structure-activity relationships and report the
identification of analogue 3 (ELA(19-32)), a fragment of ELA that binds to APJ,
activates the Gαi1 and β-arrestin-2 signaling pathways, and induces receptor
internalization similarly to its parent endogenous peptide. An alanine scan
performed on 3 revealed that the C-terminal residues are critical for binding to 
APJ and signaling. Finally, using isolated-perfused hearts and in vivo
hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements, we demonstrate that ELA and 3
both reduce arterial pressure and exert positive inotropic effects on the heart. 
Altogether, these results present ELA and 3 as potential therapeutic options in
managing cardiovascular diseases.

Hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 (HIF-1 and -2) control oxygen supply to tissues
by regulating erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. HIFs are
regulated in response to oxygen availability by prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD)
proteins, with PHD2 being the main oxygen sensor that controls HIF activity under
normoxia. In this study, we used a genetic approach to investigate the
endothelial PHD2/HIF axis in the regulation of vascular function. We found that
inactivation of Phd2 in endothelial cells specifically resulted in severe
pulmonary hypertension (∼118% increase in right ventricular systolic pressure)
but not polycythemia and was associated with abnormal muscularization of
peripheral pulmonary arteries and right ventricular hypertrophy. Concurrent
inactivation of either Hif1a or Hif2a in endothelial cell-specific Phd2 mutants
demonstrated that the development of pulmonary hypertension was dependent on
HIF-2α but not HIF-1α. Furthermore, endothelial HIF-2α was required for the
development of increased pulmonary artery pressures in a model of pulmonary
hypertension induced by chronic hypoxia. We propose that these HIF-2-dependent
effects are partially due to increased expression of vasoconstrictor molecule
endothelin 1 and a concomitant decrease in vasodilatory apelin receptor
signaling. Taken together, our data identify endothelial HIF-2 as a key
transcription factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.

Hypoxic pretreatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) enhances
therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic tissues after cell transplantation. However,
newly formed vessels generated using this approach are immature and insufficient 
for promoting functional recovery from severe ischemia. In this study, we
examined whether apelin-13, a regulator of vessel maturation, could be an
effective promoter of therapeutic angiogenesis, following severe limb ischemia.
Combinatorial treatment of hypoxic preconditioned PBMNCs with apelin-13 resulted 
in increased blood perfusion and vascular reactivity in ischemic mouse hindlimbs 
compared with a monotherapy comprising each factor. Apelin-13 upregulated
expression of PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 in hypoxic PBMNCs, as well as that of PDGFR-β in
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Proliferation and migration of VSMCs
treated with apelin-13 was accelerated in the presence of PDGF-BB. Interestingly,
expression of an apelin receptor, APJ, in PBMNC was increased under hypoxia but
not under normoxia. In addition, an in vitro angiogenesis assay using a
co-culture model comprising mouse thoracic aorta, hypoxic PBMNCs, and apelin-13
demonstrated that combinatorial treatment recruited mural cells to sprouted
vessel outgrowths from the aortic ring, thereby promoting neovessel maturation.
Thus, combinatorial injection of hypoxic PBMNCs and apelin-13 could be an
effective therapeutic strategy for patients with severe ischemic diseases.

Herein, we develop a convenient method to facilitate the solution-phase
fluorescent labelling of peptides based on the chemoselective acylation of
α-hydrazinopeptides. This approach combines the advantages of using commercially 
available amine-reactive dyes and very mild conditions, which are fully
compatible with the chemical sensitivity of the dyes. The usefulness of this
approach was demonstrated by the labelling of apelin-13 peptide. Various
fluorescent probes were readily synthesized, enabling the rapid optimization of
their affinities for the apelin receptor. Thus, the first far-red fluorescent
ligand with sub-nanomolar affinity for the apelin receptor was characterized and 
shown to track the receptor efficiently in living cells by fluorescence confocal 
microscopy.

AIMS: Leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein (LRG) is considered as a biomarker of the
clinical activities of chronic inflammatory diseases, including heart failure.
However, its pathophysiological roles in cardiac remodelling after myocardial
infarction (MI) remain to be clarified. In this study, we have addressed
functional roles of LRG in cardiac remodelling after MI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: MI was generated by ligating the left coronary artery in
mice. Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analyses revealed
that the expressions of LRG transcript and protein were up-regulated in
post-infarct myocardium. LRG protein was produced by heart-infiltrating myeloid
cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. To elucidate functional roles of LRG 
in cardiac remodelling, we generated MI in wild-type (WT) and LRG-deficient
(LRG(-/-)) mice and found that LRG gene ablation aggravated myocardial fibrosis
with cardiac dysfunction after MI. Immunohistochemical analyses with anti-CD31
antibody revealed that capillary density decreased at border zone in LRG(-/-)
mice compared with WT mice. Consistently, the expression of apelin receptor was
reduced in LRG(-/-) mice, implying that the impaired angiogenic activity is
associated with adverse cardiac remodelling in LRG(-/-) mice. Moreover, LRG gene 
ablation suppressed the activation of smad1/5/8, a pro-angiogenic signalling
pathway. Finally, the transplantation of WT bone marrow cells into LRG(-/-) mice 
attenuated cardiac fibrosis with functional improvement after MI, accompanied by 
restoration of capillary density compared with the bone marrow transplantation
from LRG(-/-) mice.
CONCLUSION: LRG, produced by heart-infiltrating myeloid cells, suppresses adverse
cardiac remodelling after MI as a novel cardioprotective factor. LRG signalling
could be a therapeutic target against cardiovascular diseases.

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can form new vessels through differentiation 
into endothelial cells (ECs), thus being important in the prevention of
hypoxia/ischemia. Apelin can activate different signaling pathways through its
receptor, APLNR, which regulate diverse biological functions, including
cardiovascular function. However, the molecular mechanism by which Apelin
mediates hypoxia-induced EPCs proliferation remain to be fully elucidated. The
present study aimed to determine the role of Apelin/APLNR signaling in
hypoxia-induced proliferation of EPCs. MTT assay was used to determine cell
proliferation. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
western blotting analysis were conducted to examine mRNA and protein expression. 
It was revealed that hypoxia promoted the proliferation of the EPCs. Further
investigation demonstrated that hypoxia promoted the expression levels of
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, Apelin and APLNR in the EPCs. In addition,
upregulation of Apelin or APLNR promoted the hypoxia-induced proliferation of the
EPCs, while knockdown of Apelin or APLNR by small interfering RNA suppressed the 
hypoxia-induced proliferation of the EPCs, suggesting that the Apelin/APLNR axis 
is involved in hypoxia-induced proliferation of EPCs. Furthermore, pretreatment
of the EPCs with SB-239063 or PD98059, two inhibitors of mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), eliminated the Apelin upregulation-induced EPC
proliferation, suggesting that MAPK signaling is a downstream effecter of
Apelin/APLNR in EPCs. Therefore, the findings of the present study indicated that
the production of HIF-1α, induced by hypoxia, activated the Apelin/APLNR and the 
downstream MAPK signaling pathways, leading to upregulated proliferation of the
EPCs. These findings suggested that Apelin/APLNR signaling may be used as a
potential therapeutic target for hypoxic/ischemic injury.

The G protein-coupled apelin receptor regulates important processes of the
cardiovascular homeostasis, including cardiac development, cardiac contractility,
and vascular tone. Most recently, a novel endogenous peptide ligand for the
apelin receptor was identified in zebrafish, and it was named
apela/elabela/toddler. The peptide was originally considered as an exclusively
embryonic regulator, and so far its function in the adult organism remains
elusive. We show here that apela is predominantly expressed in the
non-cardiomyocyte fraction in the adult rodent heart. We also provide evidence
that apela binds to apelin receptors in the heart. Using isolated adult rat
hearts, we demonstrate, that just like the fellow receptor agonist apelin, apela 
increases cardiac contractility and induces coronary vasodilation already in the 
nanomolar level. The inotropic effect, as revealed by Western blot analysis, is
accompanied by a significant increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 activation
markedly attenuates the apela-induced inotropy. Analysis of samples from
infarcted mouse hearts showed that expression of both apela and apelin receptor
is induced in failing mouse hearts and correlate with left ventricular ejection
fraction. Hence, we conclude that apela is present in the adult heart, is
upregulated in post-infarction cardiac remodeling, and increases cardiac
contractility in an ERK1/2-dependent manner.

We have previously reported the construction of a murine leukemia virus-based
replication-competent gammaretrovirus (SL3-AP) capable of utilizing the human G
protein-coupled receptor APJ (hAPJ) as its entry receptor and its natural
receptor, the murine Xpr1 receptor, with equal affinities. The apelin receptor
has previously been shown to function as a coreceptor for HIV-1, and thus,
adaptation of the viral vector to this receptor is of significant interest. Here,
we report the molecular evolution of the SL3-AP envelope protein when the virus
is cultured in cells harboring either the Xpr1 or the hAPJ receptor.
Interestingly, the dual receptor affinity is maintained even after 10 passages in
these cells. At the same time, the chimeric viral envelope protein evolves in a
distinct pattern in the apelin cassette when passaged on D17 cells expressing
hAPJ in three separate molecular evolution studies. This pattern reflects
selection for reduced ligand-receptor interaction and is compatible with a model 
in which SL3-AP has evolved not to activate hAPJ receptor
internalization.IMPORTANCE: Few successful examples of engineered retargeting of 
a retroviral vector exist. The engineered SL3-AP envelope is capable of utilizing
either the murine Xpr1 or the human APJ receptor for entry. In addition, SL3-AP
is the first example of an engineered retrovirus retaining its dual tropism after
several rounds of passaging on cells expressing only one of its receptors. We
demonstrate that the virus evolves toward reduced ligand-receptor affinity, which
sheds new light on virus adaptation. We provide indirect evidence that such
reduced affinity leads to reduced receptor internalization and propose a novel
model in which too rapid receptor internalization may decrease virus entry.

iSodium intake occurs either as a spontaneous or induced behavior, which is
enhanced, i.e., sensitized, by repeated episodes of water deprivation followed by
subsequent partial rehydration (WD-PR). In the present work, we examined whether 
repeated WD-PR alters hypothalamic transcripts related to the brain
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and apelin system in male normotensive Holtzman
rats (HTZ). We also examined whether the sodium intake of a strain with
genetically inherited high expression of the brain RAS, the spontaneously
hypertensive rat (SHR), responds differently than HTZ to repeated WD-PR. We found
that repeated WD-PR, besides enhancing spontaneous and induced 0.3 M NaCl intake,
increased the hypothalamic expression of angiotensinogen, aminopeptidase N, and
apelin receptor transcripts (43%, 60%, and 159%, respectively) in HTZ at the end 
of the third WD-PR. Repeated WD-PR did not change the daily spontaneous 0.3 M
NaCl intake and barely changed the need-induced 0.3 M NaCl intake of SHR. The
same treatment consistently enhanced spontaneous daily 0.3 M NaCl intake in the
normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. The results show that repeated WD-PR produces
alterations in hypothalamic transcripts and also sensitizes sodium appetite in
HTZ. They suggest an association between the components of hypothalamic RAS and
the apelin system, with neural and behavioral plasticity produced by repeated
episodes of WD-PR in a normotensive strain. The results also indicate that the
inherited hyperactive brain RAS is not a guarantee for sensitization of sodium
intake in the male adult SHR exposed to repeated WD-PR.

The role of the endogenous apelin system in pregnancy is not well understood.
Apelin's actions in pregnancy are further complicated by the expression of
multiple forms of the peptide. Using radioimmunoassay (RIA) alone, we established
the expression of apelin content in the chorionic villi of preeclamptic (PRE) and
normal pregnant women (NORM) at 36-38 wk of gestation. Total apelin content was
lower in PRE compared with NORM chorionic villi (49.7±3.4 vs. 72.3±9.8 fmol/mg
protein; n=20-22) and was associated with a trend for lower preproapelin mRNA in 
the PRE. Further characterization of apelin isoforms by HPLC-RIA was conducted in
pooled samples from each group. The expression patterns of apelin peptides in
NORM and PRE villi revealed little or no apelin-36 or apelin-17. Pyroglutamate
apelin-13 [(Pyr1)-apelin-13] was the predominant form of the peptide in NORM and 
PRE villi. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity was higher in PRE
villi (572.0±23.0 vs. 485.3±24.8 pmol·mg(-1)·min(-1); n=18-22). A low dose of ANG
II (1 nM; 2 h) decreased apelin release in NORM villous explants that was blocked
by the ANG II receptor 1 (AT1) antagonist losartan. Moreover, losartan enhanced
apelin release above the 2-h baseline levels in both NORM and PRE villi (P<0.05).
In summary, these studies are the first to demonstrate the lower apelin content
in human placental chorionic villi of PRE subjects using quantitative RIA.
(Pyr1)-apelin-13 is the predominant form of endogenous apelin in the chorionic
villi of NORM and PRE. The potential mechanism of lower apelin expression in the 
PRE villi may involve a negative regulation of apelin by ANG II.

Apelin is a peptide originally isolated from bovine stomach tissue extracts and
identified as an endogenous ligand of the APJ receptor; recent work showed that
apelin ameliorates the ischemic injury in the heart and the brain. Being an
analogue to the angiotensin II receptor, the apelin/APJ signaling may mediate
angiogenesis process. We explored the noninvasive intranasal brain delivery
method and investigated therapeutic effects of apelin-13 in a focal ischemic
stroke model of mice. Intranasal administration of apelin-13 (4 mg/kg) was given 
30 min after the onset of stroke and repeated once daily. Three days after
stroke, mice received apelin-13 had significantly reduced infarct volume and less
neuronal death in the penumbra. Western blot analyses showed upregulated levels
of apelin, apelin receptor APLNR, and Bcl-2 and decreased caspase-3 activation in
the apelin-13-treated brain. The proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, interleukin-1β, and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
mRNA increased in the ischemic brain, which were significantly attenuated by
apelin-13. Apelin-13 remarkably reduced microglia recruitment and activation in
the penumbra according to morphological features of Iba-1-positive cells 3 days
after ischemia. Apelin-13 significantly increased the expression of angiogenic
factor vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 14 days 
after stroke. Angiogenesis illustrated by collagen
IV + /5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridin + colabeled cells was significantly increased by the
apelin-13 treatment 21 days after stroke. Finally, apelin-13 promoted the local
cerebral blood flow restoration and long-term functional recovery. This study
demonstrates a noninvasive intranasal delivery of apelin-13 after stroke,
suggesting that the reduced inflammatory activities, decreased cell death, and
increased angiogenesis contribute to the therapeutic benefits of apelin-13.

ELABELA (ELA) is a peptide hormone required for heart development that signals
via the Apelin Receptor (APLNR, APJ). ELA is also abundantly secreted by human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which do not express APLNR. Here we show that ELA
signals in a paracrine fashion in hESCs to maintain self-renewal. ELA inhibition 
by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion, shRNA, or neutralizing antibodies causes
reduced hESC growth, cell death, and loss of pluripotency. Global
phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic analyses of ELA-pulsed hESCs show that it
activates PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling required for cell survival. ELA promotes hESC
cell-cycle progression and protein translation and blocks stress-induced
apoptosis. INSULIN and ELA have partially overlapping functions in hESC medium,
but only ELA can potentiate the TGFβ pathway to prime hESCs toward the endoderm
lineage. We propose that ELA, acting through an alternate cell-surface receptor, 
is an endogenous secreted growth factor in human embryos and hESCs that promotes 
growth and pluripotency.

OBJECTIVES: Apelin, a cytokine mainly secreted by adipocytes and several tissues,
includes the gastrointestinal tract, adipose, brain, kidney, liver, lung, and
various sites within the cardiovascular system. Apelin is closely related to
glucose metabolism, and has been proposed to be a promising therapeutic agent in 
treating insulin resistance. Apelin and orphaned G-protein-coupled apelin exhibit
roles in regulating fluid homeostasis. Circulating serum apelin suppresses
insulin secretion by binding to the G-protein-coupled apelin receptor on B cells 
of islets of Langerhans. Several studies also have documented the altered level
of serum apelin in type 2 diabetic patients, but the results remain
controversial. This study sought to analyze apelin levels in new-onset diabetes
after transplant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven diabetic renal transplant recipients were
compared with 40 nondiabetic renal transplant recipients. Data were collected for
positive family history of diabetes, body weight, body mass index, blood
pressure, and blood chemistry including apelin level. Logistic multiple analysis 
were made for statistically significant data on univariate analysis.
RESULTS: Apelin levels were significantly higher among obese,
hypercholesterolemia new-onset diabetes after transplant patients, 428.7 ±
193.29, 256.8 ± 128 (P > .001). There was appositive correlation between serum
apelin and proteinuria.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum apelin has a high level in new-onset diabetes after
transplant, than nondiabetic patients, and they positively correlate with
proteuria in new-onset diabetes after transplant patients.

ELABELA (ELA) is a novel hormone consisting of 32 amino acid peptides found in
humans as well as other vertebrates and is considered to play an important role
in the circulatory system through the apelin receptor (APJ). However, whether ELA
also acts in the central nervous system remains unknown. Here, we show that ELA
functions as an anorexigenic hormone in adult mouse brain. An
intracerebroventricular injection of ELA reduces food intake and activates
arginine vasopressin (AVP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in
the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a hypothalamic region that regulates food
intake. Cytosolic calcium ([Ca]i) measurement shows that ELA dose dependently
increases [Ca]i in single AVP and CRH-immunoreactive neurons isolated from the
PVN. Our data suggest that ELA functions as an anorexigenic hormone through
activation of AVP and CRH neurons in the PVN.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to investigate whether apelin would regulate
inflammatory response and promote survival in an experimental burn sepsis model
through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B dependent pathway.
METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were divided into the following groups: sham, burn,
burn sepsis, burn sepsis treated with apelin, burn sepsis treated with apelin
plus LY294002, and burn sepsis treated with LY294002 alone. Apelin level and
inflammatory cytokines in serum were detected by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent
assay. Apelin/APJ (apelin receptor, gene symbol APLNR) mRNA expression in spleen 
and adhesion molecules levels in lung was detected by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction. Neutrophil infiltration in lung was determined by myeloperoxidase
assay. Phosphorylation of protein kinase B in lung was determined by western
blot. Mortality rate was monitored.
RESULTS: Burn sepsis induced decreased apelin/APJ mRNA expression in spleen and
reduced apelin level in plasma, which were both restored by exogenous apelin
treatment. Burn sepsis treated with apelin resulted in decreased interleukin-6,
tumor-necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin -1β and monocyte chemotactic protein-1
levels in plasma. Mice with apelin treatment also showed decreased neutrophil
infiltration and adhesion molecules expression, accompanied by a remarkable
increased protein kinase B phosphorylation in lung tissue. The mortality rate in 
apelin treated animals was also significantly reduced. Importantly, the above
effects of apelin were abolished by LY294002 treatment.
CONCLUSION: Apelin regulates inflammatory response, diminishes inflammatory
remote organ damage and improves survival in an experimental model of burn
sepsis, which is at least partly mediated by a phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/protein kinase B dependent pathway.

Apelin is a novel bioactive peptide as the endogenous ligand for APJ. Apelin and 
APJ have also been identified in the testis, hypothalamic nuclei such as arcuate,
supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, implicating roles in the control of
reproduction. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the
effects of chronic central infusion of apelin-13 on LH, FSH and testosterone
levels and testis morphology. 21 Wistar-Albino male rats received continuous
intracerebroventricular infusion via Alzet osmotic mini pumps filled artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (vehicle) or apelin-13 at concentrations of 1 or 10 nmol (10 
μl/h) for seven days. At the last 90 min of the infusion period, the blood
samples were collected at 15 min intervals (0-90 min) for LH and FSH analyses. At
the last sampling point, the blood samples were analyzed for testosterone levels.
Infusion of high dose apelin-13 significantly suppressed LH release compared with
the vehicle values at 30, 60 and 75 min (p<0.05). However, FSH levels did not
significantly differ among the groups. Serum testosterone levels in high dose
apelin-13 group were statistically lower than the control group (p<0.05). In
addition, histological examination showed that infusion of high dose apelin-13
significantly decreased the number of Leydig cells compared with the control and 
lower dose apelin-13 groups (p<0.05, p<0.01). Our results suggest that apelin-13 
may play a role in the central regulation and decreases testosterone release by
suppressing LH secretion. Thus, antagonists of the apelin receptor may,
therefore, be useful for pharmaceuticals in the treatment of infertility.

Apelin and its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) have emerged as a key signalling
pathway in the cardiovascular system. The peptide is a potent inotropic agent and
vasodilator. Remarkably, a peptide, Elabela/Toddler, that has little sequence
similarity to apelin, has been proposed as a second endogenous apelin receptor
ligand and is encoded by a gene from a region of the genome previously classified
as 'non-coding'. Apelin is downregulated in pulmonary arterial hypertension and
heart failure. To replace the missing endogenous peptide, 'biased' apelin
agonists have been designed that preferentially activate G protein pathways,
resulting in reduced β-arrestin recruitment and receptor internalisation, with
the additional benefit of attenuating detrimental β-arrestin signalling.
Proof-of-concept studies support the clinical potential for apelin receptor
biased agonists.

Podocyte injuries are associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN).
Apelin, an adipocyte-derived peptide, has been reported to be a promoting factor 
for DN. In this study, we aim to determine whether apelin promotes progression of
DN by inducing podocyte dysfunction. kk-Ay mice were used as models for DN.
Apelin and its antagonist, F13A were intraperitoneally administered for 4 weeks, 
respectively. Renal function and foot process proteins were analysed to evaluate 
the effects of apelin on kk-Ay mice and podocytes. Apelin increased albuminuria
and decreased podocyte foot process proteins expression in kk-Ay mice, which is
consistent with the results that apelin receptor (APLNR) levels increased in
glomeruli of patients or mice with DN. In cultured podocytes, high glucose
increased APLNR expression and apelin administration was associated with
increased permeability and decreased foot process proteins levels. All these
dysfunctions were associated with decreased 26S proteasome activities and
increased polyubiquitinated proteins in both kk-Ay mice and cultured podocytes,
as demonstrated by 26S proteasome activation with cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP) or oleuropein. These effects seemed to be related to endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress, as apelin increased C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and peiFα levels
while cAMP or oleuropein reduced it in high glucose and apelin treated podocytes.
These results suggest that apelin induces podocyte dysfunction in DN through ER
stress which was induced by decreased proteasome activities in podocytes.

Apelin peptides and the apelin receptor represent a relatively new therapeutic
axis for the potential treatment of cardiovascular disease. Several reports
suggest apelin receptor activation with apelin peptides results in
cardioprotection as noted through positive ionotropy, angiogenesis, reduction of 
mean arterial blood pressure, and apoptosis. Considering the potential
therapeutic benefit attainable through modulation of the apelinergic system,
research is expanding to develop novel therapies that limit the inherent rapid
degradation of endogenous apelin peptides and produce metabolically stable small 
molecule agonists and antagonists to more rigorously interrogate the apelin
receptor system. This review details the structure-activity relationships for
chemically modified apelin peptides and recent disclosures of small molecule
agonists and antagonists and summarizes the peer reviewed and patented
literature. Development of metabolically stable ligands of apelin receptor and
their effects in various models over the coming years will hopefully lead to
establishment of this receptor as a validated target for cardiovascular
indications.

A key step in the de novo formation of the embryonic vasculature is the migration
of endothelial precursors, the angioblasts, to the position of the future
vessels. To form the first axial vessels, angioblasts migrate towards the midline
and coalesce underneath the notochord. Vascular endothelial growth factor has
been proposed to serve as a chemoattractant for the angioblasts and to regulate
this medial migration. Here we challenge this model and instead demonstrate that 
angioblasts rely on their intrinsic expression of Apelin receptors (Aplr, APJ)
for their migration to the midline. We further show that during this angioblast
migration Apelin receptor signaling is mainly triggered by the recently
discovered ligand Elabela (Ela). As neither of the ligands Ela or Apelin (Apln)
nor their receptors have previously been implicated in regulating angioblast
migration, we hereby provide a novel mechanism for regulating vasculogenesis,
with direct relevance to physiological and pathological angiogenesis.

Heart failure affects 1-2% of the adult population worldwide and coronary artery 
disease (CAD) is the underlying etiology of heart failure in 70% of the patients.
The pathway of apelin and its apelin receptor (APJ) was implicated in the
pathogenesis of heart failure in animal models, but a similar role in humans is
unknown. We studied a functional variant, rs9943582 (-154G/A), at the
5'-untranslated region, that was associated with decreased expression of the APJ 
receptor gene (APLNR) in a population consisting of 1,751 CAD cases and 1,022
controls. Variant rs9943582 was not associated with CAD, but among CAD patients, 
it showed significant association with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (431
CAD patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction or 
LVEF< 40%) versus 1,046 CAD patients without LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF>50%)
(P-adj = 6.71 × 10(-5), OR = 1.43, 95% CI, 1.20-1.70). Moreover, rs9943582 also
showed significant association with quantitative echocardiographic parameters,
including left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (effect size: increased 1.67 ± 
0.43 mm per risk allele A, P = 1.15 × 10(-4)), left atrial size (effect size:
increased 2.12 ± 0.61 mm per risk allele A, P = 9.56 × 10(-4)) and LVEF (effect
size: decreased 2.59 ± 0.32 percent per risk allele A, P = 7.50 × 10(-15)). Our
findings demonstrate that allele A of rs9943582 was significantly associated with
left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter,
the left atrial diameter and LVEF in the CAD population, which suggests an
important role of the apelin/APJ system in the pathology of heart failure
associated with ischemic heart disease.

Protection and replenishment of a functional pancreatic β-cell mass (BCM) are key
goals of all diabetes therapies. Apelin, a small regulatory peptide, is the
endogenous ligand for the apelin receptor (APJ) receptor. The apelin-APJ
signaling system is expressed in rodent and human islet cells. Apelin exposure
has been shown to inhibit and to stimulate insulin secretion. Our aim was to
assess the influence of a selective APJ deletion in pancreatic islet cells on
islet homeostasis and glucose tolerance in mice. Cre-LoxP strategy was utilized
to mediate islet APJ deletion. APJ deletion in islet cells (APJ(Δislet)) resulted
in a significantly reduced islet size, density and BCM. An ip glucose tolerance
test showed significantly impaired glucose clearance in APJ(Δislet) mice.
APJ(Δislet) mice were not insulin resistant and in vivo glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion was reduced modestly. In vitro glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion showed a significantly reduced insulin secretion by islets from
APJ(Δislet) mice. Glucose clearance in response to ip glucose tolerance test in
obese APJ(Δislet) mice fed a chronic high-fat (HF) diet, but not pregnant
APJ(Δislet) mice, was impaired significantly. In addition, the obesity-induced
adaptive elevations in mean islet size and fractional islet area were reduced
significantly in obese APJ(Δislet) mice when compared with wild-type mice.
Together, these findings demonstrate a stimulatory role for the islet cell
apelin-APJ signaling axis in regulation of pancreatic islet homeostasis and in
metabolic induced β-cell hyperplasia. The results indicate the apelin-APJ system 
can be exploited for replenishment of BCM.

Molecular pathways regulating the development of arterial and venous endothelial 
cells (ECs) are now well established, but control of parallel arterial-venous
alignment is unclear. Here we report that arterial-venous alignment in the skin
is determined by apelin receptor (APJ) expression in venous ECs. One of the
activators of APJ is apelin. We found that apelin is produced by arterial ECs
during embryogenesis, induces chemotaxis of venous ECs, and promotes the
production of secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) by APJ(+) ECs. sFRP1
stimulates matrix metalloproteinase production by Ly6B.2(+) neutrophil-like cells
located between the arteries and veins, resulting in remodeling of extracellular 
matrices to support venous displacement. Moreover, using apelin- or APJ-deficient
mice, which exhibit arterial-venous disorganization, we found that
arterial-venous alignment is involved in thermoregulation, possibly by regulating
countercurrent heat exchange. We hypothesize that the evolution of parallel
juxtapositional arterial-venous alignment was an adaptation to reduce body heat
loss.

Hypoxia-inducible factor stimulates the expression of apelin, a potent
vasodilator, in response to reduced blood arterial oxygen saturation. However,
aberrations in the apelin system impair pulmonary vascular function, potentially 
resulting in the development of high-altitude (HA)-related disorders. This study 
aimed to elucidate the genetic and epigenetic regulation of apelin, apelin
receptor (APLNR), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) in HA adaptation
and HA pulmonary edema (HAPE). A genome-wide association study and sequencing
identified variants of apelin, APLNR, and NOS3 that were validated in a larger
sample size of HAPE-patients (HAPE-p), HAPE-free controls (HAPE-f), and healthy
highland natives (HLs). Apelin-13 and nitrite levels and apelin and NOS3
expression were down-regulated in HAPE-p (P < 0.001). Among the several studied
polymorphisms, apelin rs3761581, rs2235312, and rs3115757; APLNR rs11544374 and
rs2282623; and NOS3 4b/4a, rs1799983, and rs7830 were associated with HAPE (P <
0.03). The risk allele rs3761581G was associated with a 58.6% reduction in gene
expression (P = 0.017), and the risk alleles rs3761581G and rs2235312T were
associated with low levels of apelin-13 and nitrite (P < 0.05). The latter two
levels decreased further when both of these risk alleles were present in the
patients (P < 0.05). Methylation of the apelin CpG island was significantly
higher in HAPE-p at 11.92% than in HAPE-f and HLs at ≤ 7.1% (P < 0.05). Moreover,
the methylation effect was 9% stronger in the 5' UTR and was associated with
decreased apelin expression and apelin-13 levels. The rs3761581 and rs2235312
polymorphisms and methylation of the CpG island influence the expression of
apelin in HAPE.

Very little information is available on the involvement of newly characterized
adipokines in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/antiretroviral therapy
(ART)-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS). Our aim was to determine whether 
apelin, apelin receptor, omentin, RBP4, vaspin and visfatin genetic variants and 
plasma levels are associated with HALS. We performed a cross-sectional
multicentre study that involved 558 HIV type 1-infected patients treated with a
stable highly active ART regimen, 240 of which had overt HALS and 318 who did not
have HALS. Epidemiologic and clinical variables were determined. Polymorphisms in
the apelin, omentin, RBP4, vaspin and visfatin genes were assessed by genotyping.
Plasma apelin, apelin receptor, omentin, RBP4, vaspin and visfatin levels were
determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 163 patients (81 with HALS and
82 without HALS) from whom stored plasma samples were available. Student's t
test, one-way ANOVA, chi-square test, Pearson and Spearman correlations and
linear regression analysis were used for statistical analyses. There were no
associations between the different polymorphisms assessed and the HALS phenotype.
Circulating RBP4 was significantly higher (p < 0.001) and plasma omentin was
significantly lower (p 0.001) in patients with HALS compared to those without
HALS; differences in plasma levels of the remaining adipokines were
nonsignificant between groups. Circulating RBP4 concentration was predicted
independently by the presence of HALS. Apelin and apelin receptor levels were
independently predicted by body mass index. Visfatin concentration was predicted 
independently by the presence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. HALS is
associated with higher RBP4 and lower omentin in plasma. These two adipokines,
particularly RBP4, may be a link between HIV/ART and fat redistribution
syndromes.

[Pyr(1)]apelin-13 is an endogenous vasodilator and inotrope but is downregulated 
in pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, making the apelin receptor an
attractive therapeutic target. Agonists acting at the same G-protein-coupled
receptor can be engineered to stabilize different conformational states and
function as biased ligands, selectively stimulating either G-protein or
β-arrestin pathways. We used molecular dynamics simulations of apelin/receptor
interactions to design cyclic analogues and identified MM07 as a biased agonist. 
In β-arrestin and internalization assays (G-protein-independent), MM07 was 2
orders of magnitude less potent than [Pyr(1)]apelin-13. In a G-protein-dependent 
saphenous vein contraction assay, both peptides had comparable potency
(pD2:[Pyr(1)]apelin-13 9.93±0.24; MM07 9.54±0.42) and maximum responses with a
resulting bias for MM07 of ≈350- to 1300-fold for the G-protein pathway. In rats,
systemic infusions of MM07 (10-100nmol) caused a dose-dependent increase in
cardiac output that was significantly greater than the response to
[Pyr(1)]apelin-13. Similarly, in human volunteers, MM07 produced a significant
dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow with a maximum dilatation double
that is seen with [Pyr(1)]apelin-13. Additionally, repeated doses of MM07
produced reproducible increases in forearm blood flow. These responses are
consistent with a more efficacious action of the biased agonist. In human hand
vein, both peptides reversed an established norepinephrine constrictor response
and significantly increased venous flow. Our results suggest that MM07 acting as 
a biased agonist at the apelin receptor can preferentially stimulate the
G-protein pathway, which could translate to improved efficacy in the clinic by
selectively stimulating vasodilatation and inotropic actions but avoiding
activating detrimental β-arrestin-dependent pathways.

Experimental and clinical evidences suggest that apelin and its receptor APJ are 
involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications. However, the role
of apelin/APJ in hypertension is not sufficiently understood. Because chronic
kidney diseases lead to hypertension and cardiac failure, we investigated the
changes in apelin receptor gene expression in the myocardium and aorta of rat
models of kidney disease hypertension. Two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertension
was produced by placing a clip around the renal artery. Four and 16 weeks later, 
blood pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), serum apelin,
and angiotensin II were measured. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein of APJ
were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
Western blotting. Chronic hypertensive rats had approximately 10 times higher
LVEDP (P < 0.001). 2K1C decreased serum apelin from 220 ± 11 to 170 ± 10 pg/mL in
16 weeks (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of APJ significantly decreased in the
heart and aorta at 4 weeks. At 16 weeks, the reduction was not significant in the
heart but was significant in the aorta. At 4 weeks, the expression of the APJ
protein significantly decreased in the heart but not in the aorta. At 16 weeks,
APJ protein was significantly decreased only in the aorta. Reduction of serum
apelin and downregulation of apelin receptors in both the heart and aorta may
play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and cardiac failure in 2K1C
hypertensive rats.

Elabela (ELA) or Toddler is a recently discovered hormone which is required for
normal development of heart and vasculature through activation of apelin receptor
(APJ), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), in zebrafish. The present study
explores whether the ELA-APJ signaling pathway is functional in the mammalian
system. Using reverse-transcription PCR, we found that ELA is restrictedly
expressed in human pluripotent stem cells and adult kidney whereas APJ is more
widely expressed. We next studied ELA-APJ signaling pathway in reconstituted
mammalian cell systems. Addition of ELA to HEK293 cells over-expressing GFP-AJP
fusion protein resulted in rapid internalization of the fusion receptor. In
Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells over-expressing human APJ, ELA suppresses
cAMP production with EC50 of 11.1 nM, stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation with EC50
of 14.3 nM and weakly induces intracellular calcium mobilization. Finally, we
tested ELA biological function in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and 
showed that ELA induces angiogenesis and relaxes mouse aortic blood vessel in a
dose-dependent manner through a mechanism different from apelin. Collectively, we
demonstrate that the ELA-AJP signaling pathways are functional in mammalian
systems, indicating that ELA likely serves as a hormone regulating the
circulation system in adulthood as well as in embryonic development.

PURPOSE: Apelin is an adipokine that plays a role in the regulation of many
biological functions in mammals including the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular,
immune systems, glucose homeostasis and obesity. It can act via autocrine,
paracrine, endocrine, and exocrine signaling. We aimed to identify the role of
apelin pathophysiology of diabetes.
MATERIAL/METHODS: 37 male Wistar Albino rats aged 8-10 weeks were divided in four
experimental groups as: control group (C) control+apelin group (C+A), diabetic
group (D) diabetic+apelin group (D+A). Apelin and apelin receptor mRNA gene
expressions in heart and aorta tissue were determined by real-time polymerase
chain reaction. The plasma levels of insulin and plasma apelin were determined by
ELISA.
RESULTS: Plasma levels of insulin, glucose, blood pressure levels were
significantly lower in D+A group. There was no statistically significant
difference for level of apelin between diabetic groups. On the other hand,
differences for apelin and APJ mRNA expression in heart and vascular tissue were 
found significant between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Apelin can be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of type
II diabetes in the future.

The role of apelin-13 in novel object recognition memory.

Han RW, Xu HJ, Zhang RS, Wang R.

Apelin and its receptor APJ (apelin receptor) are prominently expressed in brain 
regions involved in learning and memory. However, the role of apelin in cognition
was largely unclear. Here, the role of apelin-13 in memory processes was
investigated in mice novel object recognition task. Post-training injection of
apelin-13 (0.3 and 1 nmol) dose-dependently impaired short-term memory (STM),
however, pre-training infusion of apelin-13 (1 nmol) did not affect STM,
suggesting apelin-13 blocks formation but not acquisition of STM. Apelin-13 (1
nmol) administered immediately, 30, 60 or 120 min post-training impaired
long-term memory (LTM) in a time-dependent manner (30 min), however, both
pre-training and pre-test infusion of apelin-13 (1 nmol) did not affect LTM,
suggesting apelin-13 impaired consolidation but not acquisition and recall of
LTM. Taken together, for the first time, our results indicate that apelin-13
blocks STM formation and LTM consolidation in novel object recognition task.

Identifying coronary artery progenitors and their developmental pathways could
inspire novel regenerative treatments for heart disease. Multiple sources of
coronary vessels have been proposed, including the sinus venosus (SV),
endocardium and proepicardium, but their relative contributions to the coronary
circulation and the molecular mechanisms regulating their development are poorly 
understood. We created an ApjCreER mouse line as a lineage-tracing tool to map
SV-derived vessels onto the heart and compared the resulting lineage pattern with
endocardial and proepicardial contributions to the coronary circulation. The data
showed a striking compartmentalization to coronary development. ApjCreER-traced
vessels contributed to a large number of arteries, capillaries and veins on the
dorsal and lateral sides of the heart. By contrast, untraced vessels predominated
in the midline of the ventral aspect and ventricular septum, which are vessel
populations primarily derived from the endocardium. The proepicardium gave rise
to a smaller fraction of vessels spaced relatively uniformly throughout the
ventricular walls. Dorsal (SV-derived) and ventral (endocardial-derived) coronary
vessels developed in response to different growth signals. The absence of VEGFC, 
which is expressed in the epicardium, dramatically inhibited dorsal and lateral
coronary growth but left vessels on the ventral side unaffected. We propose that 
complementary SV-derived and endocardial-derived migratory routes unite to form
the coronary vasculature and that the former requires VEGFC, revealing its role
as a tissue-specific mediator of blood endothelial development.

Apelin is the endogenous ligand of the orphan 7-transmembrane domain GPCR APJ,
now named the apelin receptor (ApelinR). Apelin plays a prominent role in body
fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. To better understand the structural
organization of the ApelinR, we built 3 homology 3-dimensional (3D) models of the
human ApelinR using the validated cholecystokinin receptor-1 3D model or the
X-ray structures of the β2-adrenergic and CXCR4 receptors as templates. Docking
of the pyroglutamyl form of apelin 13 (pE13F) into these models revealed the
conservation at the bottom of the binding site of a hydrophobic cavity in which
the C-terminal Phe of pE13F was embedded. In contrast, at the top of the binding 
site, depending on the model, different interactions were visualized between
acidic residues of the ApelinR and the basic residues of pE13F. Using
site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that Asp 92, Glu 172, and Asp 282 of rat
ApelinR are key residues in apelin binding by interacting with Lys 8, Arg 2, and 
Arg 4 of pE13F, respectively. These residues are only seen in the CXCR4-based
ApelinR 3D model, further validating this model. These findings bring new
insights into the structural organization of the ApelinR and the mode of apelin
binding.

Acute inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenic progression of
post-ischemic neuronal damage. Apelin-13 has been investigated as a neuropeptide 
for various neurological disorders. The present study was performed to evaluate
the effects of apelin-13 on the inflammation of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R) injury. Transient focal I/R model in male Wistar rats were induced by 2h
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24h reperfusion. Rats then
received treatment with apelin-13 or vehicle after ischemia at the onset of
reperfusion. The neurological deficit was evaluated and the infarct volume was
measured by TTC staining. The activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured. The
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
were measured using real-time PCR. And the expression of apelin receptor (APJ),
ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1), glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were measured by
immunohistochemistry and western blot. Our results demonstrated that treatment
with apelin-13 in I/R rats markedly reduced neurological deficits and the infarct
volume. The increase of MPO activity induced by I/R was inhibited by apelin-13
treatment. The real-time PCR showed that apelin-13 decreased the expression of
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α and ICAM-1 in I/R rats. The
expression of APJ in I/R rats was increased. And the expression of Iba1, GFAP and
HMGB1 in I/R rats was decreased by apelin-13 treatment indicating the inhibition 
of microglia, astrocytes and other inflammatory cells. In conclusion, apelin-13
is neuroprotective for neurons against I/R through inhibiting the
neuroinflammation.

The apelin receptor: physiology, pathology, cell signalling, and ligand
modulation of a peptide-activated class A GPCR.

The apelin receptor (AR or APJ) is a class A (rhodopsin-like) G-protein-coupled
receptor with wide distribution throughout the human body. Activation of the AR
by its cognate peptide ligand, apelin, induces diverse physiological effects
including vasoconstriction and dilation, strengthening of heart muscle
contractility, angiogenesis, and regulation of energy metabolism and fluid
homeostasis. Recently, another endogenous peptidic activator of the AR,
Toddler/ELABELA, was identified as having a crucial role in zebrafish (Danio
rerio) embryonic development. The AR is also implicated in pathologies including 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer, making it a promising
therapeutic target. Despite its established importance, the precise roles of AR
signalling remain poorly understood. Moreover, little is known about the
mechanisms of peptide-AR activation. Additional complexity arises from modulation
of the AR by 2 endogenous peptide ligands, both with multiple bioactive isoforms 
of variable length and distribution. The various apelin and Toddler/ELABELA
isoforms may also produce distinct cellular effects. Further complexity arises
through formation of functionally distinct heterodimers between the AR and other 
G-protein-coupled receptors. This minireview outlines key (patho)physiological
actions of the AR, addresses what is known about signal transduction downstream
of AR activation, and concludes by discussing unique properties of the endogenous
peptidic ligands of the AR.

Phosphorylation plays vital roles in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) functions. The apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) system is involved in the 
regulation of cardiovascular function and central control of body homeostasis.
Here, using tandem mass spectrometry, we first identified phosphorylated serine
residues in the C terminus of APJ. To determine the role of phosphorylation sites
in APJ-mediated G protein-dependent and -independent signaling and function, we
induced a mutation in the C-terminal serine residues and examined their effects
on the interaction between APJ with G protein or GRK/β-arrestin and their
downstream signaling. Mutation of serine 348 led to an elimination of both GRK
and β-arrestin recruitment to APJ induced by apelin-13. Moreover, APJ
internalization and G protein-independent ERK signaling were also abolished by
point mutation at serine 348. In contrast, this mutant at serine residues had no 
demonstrable impact on apelin-13-induced G protein activation and its
intracellular signaling. These findings suggest that mutation of serine 348
resulted in inactive GRK/β-arrestin. However, there was no change in the active G
protein thus, APJ conformation was biased. These results provide important
information on the molecular interplay and impact of the APJ function, which may 
be extrapolated to design novel drugs for cardiac hypertrophy based on this
biased signal pathway.

This Letter describes methodology to enable the identification of tool or
therapeutic lipopeptides which modulate the function of membrane bound proteins. 
The choice of lipopeptides as a chemotype is the amalgamation of multiple
medicinal chemistry considerations including duration of action, low systemic
exposure and access to intracellular components. The 'lipopeptide shuffle' has
been applied here to the APJ receptor and has rapidly resulted in the discovery
of a 33 nM APJ agonist hit from an initial 369 member lipopeptide synthetic
array.

During our research on apelin receptor (APJ) signalling in living cells with BRET
and FRET, we demonstrated that apelin-13 stimulation can lead to the activation
of Gαi2 or Gαi3 through undergoing a molecular rearrangement rather than
dissociation in HEK293 cells expressing APJ. Furthermore, Gαo and Gαq also showed
involvement in APJ activation through a classical dissociation model. However,
both FRET signal and BRET ratio between fluorescent Gαi1 subunit and Gβγ subunits
demonstrated little change after apelin-13 stimulation. These results
demonstrated that stimulation of APJ with apelin-13 causes activation of Gαi2,
Gαi3, Gαo, Gαq; among which Gαi2, Gαi3 were activated through a novel
rearrangement process. These results provide helpful data for understanding APJ
mediated G-protein signalling.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In human adults, and animals, the Apelin-APJ ligand-receptor
system is emerging as having a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular
function and heart failure. The aim was to investigate expression, and regulation
by oxygen, of the Apelin APJ receptor (APJ) in myocardium obtained from children 
undergoing corrective surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of
congenital heart defects.
METHODS: Western blotting and Real-time PCR were used to determine if APJ was
expressed in the infant myocardium, if expression was influenced by the duration 
of myocardial ischemia and if any relationship existed between APJ expression and
early post-operative outcome. The next aim was to determine if there was a
difference in mRNA expression of APJ in myocardium from cyanotic patients
compared with acyanotic patients and if re-perfusing myocardium in vitro with
either hypoxic, normoxic or hyperoxic oxygen affected APJ mRNA expression.
RESULTS: APJ was expressed in all myocardial samples and myocardium exposed to
longer durations of ischemia and cardioplegia expressed higher levels of APJ
(p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between APJ expression in
myocardium resected after 10 min with both oxygen extraction ratio (p=0.021,
rho= -0.523) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (p=0.028, rho 0.52). This
association did not exist for myocardium collected before 10 min. There was no
difference in APJ expression between cyanotic and acyanotic patients. No
difference was found in APJ expression whether re-perfused with low, normal or
high oxygen.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in APJ expression were observed during cardiopulmonary
bypass in children and the reasons for this require further investigation.

Dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for receptor
function including agonist affinity, efficacy, trafficking and specificity of
signal transduction, including G protein coupling. Emerging data suggest that the
cardiovascular system is the main target of apelin, which exerts an overall
neuroprotective role, and is a positive regulator of angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) in heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 cleaves off C-terminal residues 
of vasoactive peptides including apelin-13, and neurotensin that activate the
apelin receptor (APJ) and neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) respectively, that
belong to the A class of GPCRs. Therefore, based on the similar mode of
modification by ACE2 at peptide level, the homology at amino acid level and the
capability of forming dimers with other GPCRs, we have been suggested that APJ
and NTSR1 can form a functional heterodimer. Using co-immunoprecipitation, BRET
and FRET, we provided conclusive evidence of heterodimerization between APJ and
NTSR1 in a constitutive and induced form. Upon agonist stimulation,
hetrodimerization enhanced ERK(1/2) activation and increased proliferation via
activation of Gq α-subunits. These novel data provide evidence for a
physiological role of APJ/NTSR1 heterodimers in terms of ERK(1/2) activation and 
increased intracellular calcium and induced cell proliferation and provide
potential new pharmaceutical targets for cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is caused by excessive cell
proliferation and fibrosis, which obliterate the lumen of pulmonary venules,
leading to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and death. This
condition has no effective treatment and a 5-year survival of <5%. Understanding 
the mechanism of this disease and designing effective therapies are urgently
needed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We show that mice with homozygous deletion of the Ets
transcription factor Erg die between embryonic day 16.5 and 3 months of age as a 
result of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, capillary hemorrhage, and
pancytopenia. We demonstrate that Erg binds to and serves as a transcriptional
activator of the G-protein-coupled receptor gene Aplnr, the expression of which
is uniquely specific for venous endothelium and that knockout of either Erg or
Aplnr results in pulmonary venule-specific endothelial proliferation in vitro. We
show that mice with either homozygous-global or endothelium-directed deletion of 
Aplnr manifest pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and right heart failure,
detectable at 8 months of age. Levels of pulmonary ERG and APLNR in patients with
pulmonary veno-occlusive disease undergoing lung transplantation were
significantly lower than those of control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ERG and APLNR are essential for endothelial
homeostasis in venules in the lung and that perturbation in ERG-APLNR signaling
is crucial for the development of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. We identify
this pathway as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this
incurable disease.

OBJECTIVE: The apelinergic system has been previously described to participate in
fluid homeostasis, cardiac contractility, blood pressure and neo-vascularization.
The role of apelin in obesity and glucose metabolism has also lately gained
interest; however, it still remains obscure. This study aimed to assess serum
apelin levels in obese youngsters and to investigate any possible association
with the G212A polymorphism of the apelin receptor (APLNR) gene.
METHODS: Ninety obese individuals and 90 matched for age and gender lean controls
were included. Anthropometric measurements, data of glucose metabolism, including
an oral glucose tolerance test, and serum apelin levels were obtained. The
presence of the G212A polymorphism of the APLNR gene was also analyzed in the
obese group.
RESULTS: Obese participants had significantly lower serum apelin levels as
compared with controls (P = 0.011). After being grouped according to their status
of glucose metabolism, only obese subjects with impaired glucose metabolism
(diabese) exhibited lower apelin levels as compared with controls. The presence
of the G212A polymorphism did not differ from the HapMap-reported frequencies in 
Caucasians (GG = 53.3%/GA = 38.9%/ΑΑ = 7.8% vs. GG = 46.9%/GA = 39.8%/ΑΑ = 13.3%,
P = 0.232). The GG and GA obese subgroups had significantly lower apelin levels
as compared with the AA group (P = 0.013 and P = 0.016, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Obese (especially diabese) youngsters demonstrated lower serum apelin
levels; the G212A polymorphism of the APLNR gene was found to exert a favourable 
effect on circulating apelin levels in childhood obesity.

Apelin plays a prominent role in body fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. We
previously showed that the C-terminal Phe of apelin 17 (K17F) is crucial for
triggering apelin receptor internalization and decreasing blood pressure (BP) but
is not required for apelin binding or Gi protein coupling. Based on these
findings, we hypothesized that the important role of the C-terminal Phe in BP
decrease may be as a Gi-independent but β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathway
that could involve MAPKs. For this purpose, we have used apelin fragments K17F
and K16P (K17F with the C-terminal Phe deleted), which exhibit opposite profiles 
on apelin receptor internalization and BP. Using BRET-based biosensors, we showed
that whereas K17F activates Gi and promotes β-arrestin recruitment to the
receptor, K16P had a much reduced ability to promote β-arrestin recruitment while
maintaining its Gi activating property, revealing the biased agonist character of
K16P. We further show that both β-arrestin recruitment and apelin receptor
internalization contribute to the K17F-stimulated ERK1/2 activity, whereas the
K16P-promoted ERK1/2 activity is entirely Gi-dependent. In addition to providing 
new insights on the structural basis underlying the functional selectivity of
apelin peptides, our study indicates that the β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2
activation and not the Gi-dependent signaling may participate in K17F-induced BP 
decrease.

It is known that apelin has definite protective effects on various cardiovascular
diseases; however, the mechanism through which hypertension with heart failure
(H-HF) is affected by pyroglutamylated apelin-13 (Pyr-AP13) remain unclear. Thus,
in the present study, we investigated the effects of apelin on the cardiac
hemodynamics in rats with hypertension and heart failure. In our study, cardiac
function, dimensions and histological determination of the fibrosis of rats with 
two-kidney, one-clip induced hypertension and sham-operated rats were assessed
using an echocardiography system and Masson's trichrome. The infusion of either
5% glucose injection (GS) alone or 5% GS containing Pyr-AP13 as a dose,
time-matched design on the cardiac hemodynamics in H-HF rats and sham-operated
rats was recorded. For the determination of the effects of potential related
proteins on cardiac hemodynamics in the H-HF rats, the animals were divided into 
5 groups: i) the sham-operated group (n=8); ii) H-HF (n=8); iii) H-HF with
infusion of 0.1 µg dose of Pyr-AP13 (n=8) or 5% glucose (GS) (n=8); iv) H-HF with
infusion of 1 µg dose of Pyr-AP13 (n=8) or 5% GS (n=8); and v) H-HF with infusion
of 10 µg dose of Pyr-AP13 (n=8) or 5% GS (n=8). The concentration of cyclic
adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) was determined by ELISA. The expression of
membrane and cytosolic proteins was evaluated by western blot analysis.
Significant cardiac and perivascular fibrosis was observed in the H-HF rats.
Following the infusion of Pyr-AP13, the systolic and diastolic function was
significantly improved in the cardiac hemodynamic parameters in the H-HF rats
treated with Pyr-AP13. The apelin receptor (APJ), which was activated by the
exogenous infusion of Pyr-AP13, was partially recycled from the cytoplasm back to
the plasma membrane; however, membrane APJ was eventually downregulated in the
H-HF rats treated with Pyr-AP13 compared with the sham-operated group rats. Our
findings suggested that a complex was formed after Pyr-AP13 combined with
cellular membrane APJ receptor. However, the endogenous downregulation of the APJ
receptor results in benefits from the exogenous administration of apelin.

G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are inherently dynamic membrane protein
modulators of various important cellular signaling cascades. The apelin receptor 
(AR or APJ) is a class A GPCR involved in numerous physiological processes,
implicated in angiogenesis during tumour formation and as a CD4 co-receptor for
entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to cells. Due to the lack of
efficient methods to produce full-length GPCRs enriched with nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) active (15)N, (13)C, and (or) (2)H isotopes, small GPCR fragments
typically comprising 1-2 transmembrane segments are frequently studied using NMR 
spectroscopy. Here, we report successful overexpression of transmembrane segments
1-3 of AR (AR_TM1-3) in the C41(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli using an AT-rich 
gene tag previously reported to enhance cell-free expression yields. The
resulting protein, with 6 additional N-terminal residues due to the expression
tag, was purified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Far UV
circular dichroism spectropolarimetry demonstrates that AR_TM1-3 has the
predicted ~40% α-helical character in membrane-mimetic environments. (1)H-(15)N
HSQC NMR experiments imply amenability to high-resolution NMR structural
characterization and stability in solution for weeks. Notably, this small
expression tag approach may also be generally applicable to other membrane
proteins that are difficult to express in E. coli.

The identification of molecules controlling embryonic patterning and their
functional analysis has revolutionized the fields of Developmental and Cell
Biology. The use of new sequence information and modern bioinformatics tools has 
enriched the list of proteins that could potentially play a role in regulating
cell behavior and function during early development. The recent application of
efficient methods for gene knockout in zebrafish has accelerated the functional
analysis of many proteins, some of which have been overlooked due to their small 
size. Two recent publications report on the identification of one such protein
and its role in zebrafish embryogenesis. The protein, currently designated Apela,
was shown to act as a secreted protein whose absence adversely affected various
early developmental processes. Additional signaling proteins that have been
identified in one of the studies are likely to open the way to unraveling
hitherto unknown developmental pathways and have the potential to provide a more 
comprehensive understanding of known developmental processes.

Apelin receptor: its responsiveness to stretch mechanisms and its potential for
cardiovascular therapy.

(1)Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

It has recently been demonstrated that the apelin receptor (APJ) plays a
significant role in mediating the stretch response within the heart in a
G-protein-independent and β-arrestin-dependent fashion. This discovery adds to
the consolidated literature describing the potential benefits of APJ agonists. In
this review, the authors will examine the functional selectivity of APJ and
stretch with respect to their ability to signal via both G-protein-dependent and 
G-protein-independent mechanisms, with a focus on the multifunctional protein,
β-arrestin. The possibility of selecting or designing novel ligands that
differentially activate only a subset of functions via a single receptor holds
great promise for the treatment of diseases such as heart failure and
hypertension. Finally, hypothetical approaches to target APJ, taking into account
its downstream pathways, will be described.

Apelin receptor (APJ) and bradykinin 1 receptor (B1R) are involved in a variety
of important physiological processes, which share many similar characteristics in
distribution and functions in the cardiovascular system. This study explored the 
possibility of heterodimerization between APJ and B1R, and investigated the
impact of heterodimer on the signal transduction characteristics and the
physiological functions in human endothelial cells after stimulation with their
agonists. We first identified the endogenous expression of APJ and B1R in HUVECs 
and their co-localization on HEK293 membrane. The constitutive heterodimerization
between the APJ and B1R was then demonstrated by BRET and FRET assays.
Stimulation with Apelin-13 and des -Arg(9)-BK enhanced the phosphorylation of
eNOS in HUVECs, which could be dampened by the knockdown of APJ or B1R,
indicating the co-existence of APJ and B1R is critical for eNOS phosphorylation
in HUVECs. Furthermore, APJ/B1R heterodimers were found to enhance the activity
of PKC signaling pathway and increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in
HEK293 cells, which might be the mechanism of APJ/B1R heterodimers promoting the 
phosphorylation of eNOS and leads to increased Gαq, PKC signal pathway activities
and a significant increase in cell proliferation. The results provide a new
theoretical and experimental base for revealed intracellular molecular mechanisms
of physiological function involved in the APJ and B1R and provide potential new
targets for the development of drugs and treating cardiovascular disease.

Apelin is the endogenous ligand for the previously orphaned G protein-coupled
receptor APJ. Apelin and its receptor are widely distributed in the brain, heart,
and vasculature, and are emerging as an important regulator of body fluid
homeostasis and cardiovascular functions. To further progress in the pharmacology
and the physiological role of the apelin receptor, the development of small,
bioavailable agonists and antagonists of the apelin receptor, is crucial. In this
context, E339-3D6 (1) was described as the first nonpeptidic apelin receptor
agonist. We show here that 1 is actually a mixture of polymethylated species, and
we describe an alternative and versatile solid-phase approach that allows access 
to highly pure 27, the major component of 1. This approach was also applied to
prepare a series of derivatives in order to identify the crucial structural
determinants required for the ligand to maintain its affinity for the apelin
receptor as well as its capacity to promote apelin receptor signaling and
internalization. The study of the structure-activity relationships led to the
identification of ligands 19, 21, and 38, which display an increased affinity
compared to that of 27. The latter and 19 behave as full agonists with regard to 
cAMP production and apelin receptor internalization, whereas 21 is a biased
agonist toward cAMP production. Interestingly, the three ligands display a much
higher stability in mouse plasma (T1/2 > 10 h) than the endogenous apelin-17
peptide 2 (T1/2 < 4 min).

Apelin has been identified as an endogenous ligand of the orphan
G-protein-coupled apelin receptor (APJR). These receptors are widely expressed in
the central nervous system and periphery and play a role in the regulation of
fluid and glucose homeostasis, feeding behavior, vessel formation, cell
proliferation and immunity. We aimed to investigate whether water immersion and
restraint stress have effects on apelin and APJR expression and apoptosis in
heart tissue of male Wistar rats. The cardiac tissues were obtained from control,
water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS) and apelin antagonist (F13A)+WIRS
groups of rats and embedded in paraffin wax. Immunohistochemical staining methods
were used to localize apelin, APJR and TUNEL immunopositive cells. H-SCORE was
used for semi-quantitative determinations. Apelin protein levels were determined 
by Western blot in the cardiac tissues and plasma corticosteroid levels were
measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Apelin immunolocalization was found
especially in endothelial cells and mast cells and faintly in cardiomyocytes,
APJR immunostaining was shown in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and TUNEL 
reaction was observed in endothelial cells and in some fibroblasts. Apelin
expression was significantly increased in the WIRS and F13A+WIRS groups compared 
to the control group. The APJR reaction was similar in all groups. The number of 
TUNEL-positive cells was significantly higher in the F13A+WIRS group than that of
the control group. Our study showed that WIRS for 6h increased plasma
corticosterone levels and cardiac apelin expression in rats. The increased levels
of apelin inhibited stress-induced apoptosis in heart. These results may be
important for the therapeutic approach to a variety of stress-related heart
disease.

Angiogenesis plays an important role in myocardial infarction. Apelin and its
natural receptor (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 or APLNR) induce
sprouting of endothelial cells in an autocrine or paracrine manner. The aim of
this study is to investigate whether apelin can improve the cardiac function
after myocardial infarction by increasing angiogenesis in infarcted myocardium.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular end systolic
pressure (LVESP), left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), maximal left
ventricular pressure development (±LVdp/dtmax), infarct size, and angiogenesis
were evaluated to analyze the cardioprotective effects of apelin on ischemic
myocardium. Assays of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, wound healing, transwells, and
tube formation were used to detect the effects of apelin on proliferation,
migration, and chemotaxis of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Fluorescein
isothiocyanate-labeled bovine serum albumin penetrating through monolayered
cardiac microvascular endothelial cells was measured to evaluate the effects of
apelin on permeability of microvascular endothelial cells. In vivo results showed
that apelin increased ±LV dp/dtmax and LVESP values, decreased LVEDP values (all 
p < 0.05), and promoted angiogenesis in rat heart after ligation of the left
anterior descending coronary artery. In vitro results showed that apelin
dose-dependently enhanced proliferation, migration, chemotaxis, and tube
formation, but not permeability of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.
Apelin also increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor
receptors-2 (VEGFR2) and the endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinase
(Tie-2) in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. These results indicated that 
apelin played a protective role in myocardial infarction through promoting
angiogenesis and decreasing permeability of microvascular endothelial cells via
upregulating the expression of VEGFR2 and Tie-2 in cardiac microvascular
endothelial cells.
