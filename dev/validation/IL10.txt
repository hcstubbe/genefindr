BACKGROUND: Intraoperative hemolysis and inflammation are associated with acute
kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery. Plasma-free hemoglobin induces
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. HO-1 degrades heme but increases in
experimental models of AKI. This study tested the hypothesis that plasma HO-1
concentrations are associated with intraoperative hemolysis and are increased in 
patients that develop AKI following cardiac surgery.
METHODS: We measured plasma HO-1, free hemoglobin, and inflammatory markers in 74
patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). AKI was defined as an increase 
in serum creatinine concentration of 50% or 0.3 mg/dl within 72 h of surgery.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of patients developed AKI. HO-1 concentrations
increased from 4.2 ± 0.2 ng/ml at baseline to 6.6 ± 0.5 ng/ml on postoperative
day (POD) 1 (p < 0.001). POD1 HO-1 concentrations were 3.1 ng/ml higher (95% CI
1.1-5.1) in AKI patients, as was the change in HO-1 from baseline to POD1 (4.4 ± 
1.3 ng/ml in AKI patients vs. 1.5 ± 0.3 ng/ml in no-AKI patients, p = 0.006).
HO-1 concentrations remained elevated in AKI patients even after controlling for 
AKI risk factors and preoperative drug therapy. Peak-free hemoglobin
concentrations correlated with peak HO-1 concentrations on POD1 in patients that 
developed AKI (p = 0.02). Duration of CPB and post-CPB IL-6 and IL-10
concentrations were also associated with increased HO-1 on POD1.
CONCLUSION: Plasma HO-1 is increased in patients that develop AKI, and CPB
duration, hemolysis, and inflammation are associated with increased HO-1
concentrations following cardiac surgery. Strategies that alter hemolysis and
HO-1 expression during cardiac surgery may affect risk for AKI.

BACKGROUND: Obesity-related metabolic disorders are closely associated with
inflammation induced by innate immunity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a
pivotal role in the innate immune system by activating proinflammatory signaling 
pathways. GIT27 (4,5-dihydro-3-phenyl-5-isoxasole acetic acid) is an active
immunomodulatory agent that primarily targets macrophages and inhibits secretion 
of tumor necrosis factor α [as well as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, and interferon
γ]. However, the effect of TLR antagonist on kidney diseases has rarely been
reported. We investigated whether the TLR antagonist GIT27 has beneficial effects
on the progression of kidney disease in obese mice on a high-fat diet (HFD).
METHODS: Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: mice fed 
with normal chow diet (N=4); mice fed with a HFD (60% of total calories from fat,
5.5% from soybean oil, and 54.5% from lard, N=4); and GIT27-treated mice fed with
a HFD (N=7).
RESULTS: Glucose intolerance, oxidative stress, and lipid abnormalities in HFD
mice were improved by GIT27 treatment. In addition, GIT27 treatment decreased the
urinary excretion of albumin and protein in obesity-related kidney disease,
urinary oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory cytokine levels. This
treatment inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the kidneys
and adipose tissue, and improved extracellular matrix expansion and
tubulointerstitial fibrosis in obesity-related kidney disease.
CONCLUSION: TLR inhibition by administering GIT27 improved metabolic parameters. 
GIT27 ameliorates abnormalities of lipid metabolism and may have renoprotective
effects on obesity-related kidney disease through its anti-inflammatory
properties.

Inteleurkin-22 (IL-22) is a IL-10 family cytokine member and is mainly produced
by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), Th17 cells, and Th22 cells. Previous studies
have indicated that IL-23 and several transcription factors, including STAT3,
RORγt, and the AhR are important stimulus. Recently, there is emerging evidence
that Tregs can regulate IL-22 expression. In the review, we discuss the updated
advancement on Tregs function and its regulatory role on IL-22 expression.

Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is an important periodontal pathogen that
can participate in periodontitis and other non-oral infections. The cytolethal
distending toxin (Cdt) is among the virulence factors produced by this bacterium.
The Cdt is also secreted by several mucosa-associated Gram-negative pathogens and
may play a role in perpetuating the infection by modulating the immune response. 
Although the toxin targets a wide range of eukaryotic cell types little is known 
about its activity on macrophages which play a key part in alerting the rest of
the immune system to the presence of pathogens and their virulence factors. In
view of this, we tested the hypothesis that the A. actinomycetemcomitans Cdt
(AaCdt) disrupts macrophage function by inhibiting phagocytic activity as well as
affecting the production of cytokines. Murine macrophages were co-cultured with
either wild-type A. actinomycetemcomitans or a Cdt(-) mutant. Viable counts and
qPCR showed that phagocytosis of the wild-type strain was significantly reduced
relative to that of the Cdt(-) mutant. Addition of recombinant Aa(r)Cdt to
co-cultures along with the Cdt(-) mutant diminished the phagocytic activity
similar to that observed with the wild type strain. High concentrations of
Aa(r)Cdt resulted in decreased phagocytosis of fluorescent bioparticles. Nitric
oxide production was modulated by the presence of Cdt and the levels of IL-1β,
IL-12 and IL-10 were increased. Production of TNF-α did not differ in the
co-culture assays but was increased by the presence of Aa(r)Cdt. These data
suggest that the Cdt may modulate macrophage function in A. actinomycetemcomitans
infected sites by impairing phagocytosis and modifying the
pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance.

OBJECTIVE: Cannabinoid receptors are activated in murine macrophages upon
exposure to oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL), and type-1 cannabinoid
receptor (CB1R) is considered as a risk factor in atherosclerosis, because it
promotes cholesterol accumulation and release of inflammatory mediators.
Conversely, accumulated evidence suggests a protective role for type-2
cannabinoid receptor (CB2R). Here, we sought to ascertain whether different
elements of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) were activated in human lipid-laden 
macrophages, and whether CB2R played any role in atherogenesis and inflammation
of these cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Human macrophages were exposed to oxLDL in order to obtain
lipid-laden foam cells. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used 
to measure the production of the endocannabinoids in both macrophages and foam
cells, and radiometric assays were performed to measure cannabinoid receptor
binding and activity of endocannabinoid metabolizing enzymes. OxLDL accumulation 
was investigated by confocal imaging, and cytokine production and release were
measured by means of flow cytometry and ELISA. The results showed that human
macrophages possess a fully functional ECS, which was modulated by oxLDL.
Selective CB2R activation reduced cellular oxLDL accumulation, which was
associated with decreased expression of CD36 scavenger receptor, and decreased
production of TNFα, IL-12 and IL-10. These anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory
effects were reverted by the selective CB2R antagonist SR144528.
CONCLUSIONS: A fully active ECS is present in human macrophages and
macrophage-derived foam cells. Selective activation of CB2R reduces
CD36-dependent oxLDL accumulation and modulates production of inflammatory
cytokines, thus representing a potential therapeutic strategy to combat
atherosclerosis.

Research Campus, Appalachian State University, Kannapolis, NC, USA.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE: 1) the extent to which an acute
session of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) increases systemic
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and 2) whether 2 weeks of HIIT training
alters the inflammatory response. Eight recreationally active males (aged 22±2
years) performed 2 weeks of HIIT on a cycle ergometer (six HIIT sessions at 8-12 
intervals; 60-second intervals, 75-second active rest) at a power output
equivalent to 100% of their predetermined peak oxygen uptake (VO2max). Serum
samples were collected during the first and sixth HIIT sessions at rest and
immediately, 15, 30, and 45 minutes post-exercise. An acute session of HIIT
induced significant increases in interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis 
factor-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 compared with rest. The
concentrations of interferon-γ, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor,
and IL-1β were unaltered with an acute session of HIIT Two weeks of training did 
not alter the inflammatory response to an acute bout of HIIT exercise. Maximal
power achieved during a VO2max test significantly increased 4.6%, despite no
improvements in VO2max after 2 weeks of HIIT. These data suggest that HIIT
exercise induces a small inflammatory response in young, recreationally active
men; however, 2 weeks of HIIT does not alter this response.

BACKGROUND: Pain plays roles in both the nervous system and immune system.
Changes in the neuroendocrine pathway under pain conditions give rise to
sympathetic outflow with increased plasma catecholamines and activate immune
reactions. Dexmedetomidine exerts sedative, analgesic, and anesthetic-sparing
effects and is known to diminish pro-inflammatory processes by central
sympatholytic effects. To investigate the influence of the analgesic effect of
dexmedetomidine on immunomodulation under pain conditions, splenic natural killer
(NK) tumoricidal cytotoxic activity, proliferative ability of T lymphocytes, and 
cytokine changes were assessed.
METHODS: After evaluation of the analgesic efficacy of dexmedetomidine in C57BL
mice that were subjected to formalin-induced pain, dexmedetomidine (30 µg/kg) or 
saline was injected intraperitoneally (ip) 30 min before formalin (20 µL of 2%
formalin in 0.9% saline) injection. NK cell activity against NK-sensitive YAC-1
lymphoma cells was evaluated by the percentage of specific lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) release. Various numbers of effector cells (NK cells) were added to the
wells of a microtiter plate containing 2 × 10(4) target YAC-1 cells in 100 μL, to
achieve final effector-to-target cell ratios of 80:1, 40:1, and 20:1. The level
of lymphocyte proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was detected 
by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 levels
were determined in blood samples and supernatants of splenocyte preparations.
RESULTS: IP administration of dexmedetomidine significantly decreased the time of
licking and biting during the first and second phases of the formalin test (p
<0.001). Formalin-induced pain led to higher activity of NK cells than in
sham-treated mice (p <0.05), but NK activity was not increased significantly by
ip dexmedetomidine treatment. Formalin-induced pain significantly increased
splenic lymphocyte proliferation (p <0.05), but dexmedetomidine did not alter
this response. There was a significant increase in plasma TNF-α (p = 0.048) and
IL-6 (p = 0.014) levels after formalin-induced pain. However, the differences
between the responses after ip dexmedetomidine did not change significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine showed antinociceptive effect on both of acute pain 
phase 1 and hyperalgesic phase 2 of formalin pain model. Formalin-induced pain
alters cellular immunity of spleen in mice. Dexmedetomidine attenuates the
activation of NK cells under pain condition, but neither the proliferative
response of the splenic lymphocytes nor the cytokine production was affected by
dexmedetomidine.

Paricalcitol, a selective vitamin D receptor (VDR) activator used for treatment
of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD), has been
associated with survival advantages, suggesting that this drug, beyond its
ability to suppress parathyroid hormone, may have additional beneficial actions. 
In this prospective, nonrandomised, open-label, proof-of-concept study, we
evaluated the hypothesis that selective vitamin D receptor activation with
paricalcitol is an effective target to modulate inflammation in CKD patients.
Eight patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and
44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and an intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level higher than
110 pg/mL received oral paricalcitol (1  μg/48 hours) as therapy for secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Nine patients matched by age, sex, and stage of CKD, but a
PTH level <110 pg/mL, were enrolled as a control group. Our results show that
five months of paricalcitol administration were associated with a reduction in
serum concentrations of hs-CRP (13.9%, P < 0.01), TNF-α (11.9%, P = 0.01), and
IL-6 (7%, P < 0.05), with a nonsignificant increase of IL-10 by 16%. In addition,
mRNA expression levels of the TNFα and IL-6 genes in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells decreased significantly by 30.8% (P = 0.01) and 35.4% (P = 0.01),
respectively. In conclusion, selective VDR activation is an effective target to
modulate inflammation in CKD.

OBJECTIVES: To explore synergistic effect between angiotensin II receptor
blockers (ARBs) and statins on Th17/Treg functional imbalance in hypertensive
patients with carotid atherosclerosis.
METHODS: This study was a 2 × 2 factorial randomized, prospective, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial. One hundred and fifty nine hypertensive patients with
carotid atherosclerosis were randomized to the administration of control group,
telmisartan group, rosuvastatin group, and combination group (telmisartan plus
rosuvastatin) base on hydrochlorothiazide treatment. Carotid ultrasonography,
parameters of Th17/Treg functional axis, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, interferon
(IFN)-γ, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), monocyte chemotactic protein 
(MCP)-1 were evaluated.
RESULTS: Blood pressure level markedly reduced in four groups. There was
significantly synergistic effect of combination of telmisartan with rosuvastatin 
on reducing carotid imtima-media thickness (IMT), Th17 cells frequency, IL-17,
IL-6, IL-23, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, expression of retinoic acid
receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)γt mRNA, Th17/Treg ratio, IL-1β, IL-2,
IFN-γ, hsCRP, and MCP-1, and increasing Treg cells frequency, IL-10, transforming
growth factor(TGF)-β1, and expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription
factor (Foxp3) mRNA (all P<0.05). Change rate of IMT statistical positively
related to descent rates of Th17 cells frequency, IL-17, IL-6, IL-23, TNF-α,
expression of RORγt mRNA, Th17/Treg ratio, IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-γ, hsCRP, and MCP-1, 
and negatively related to increased rates of Treg frequency, IL-10, TGF-β1, and
expression of Foxp3 mRNA, respectively (all P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: There is a synergistic effect of combination of telmisartan with
rosuvastatin on ameliorating Th17/Treg functional imbalance in hypertensive
patients with carotid atherosclerosis.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), a therapeutic preparation containing pooled
human immunoglobulin (Ig) G, has been suggested to inhibit differentiation and
maturation of dendritic cells (DCs); however, controversies exist on this issue. 
We aimed to reinvestigate the effects of IVIg on human DC maturation and cytokine
production, and to determine whether an artifactual determinant is involved in
the observed effects. Human monocyte-derived DCs or freshly isolated blood
myeloid DCs were cultured in the presence of IVIg in vitro, and the expression of
maturation markers CD80, CD86, CD83, and Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR were
determined by flow cytometry, whereas production of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10
was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and T-cell stimulatory
capacity was determined in cocultures with allogeneic CD4(+) T cells.
Interestingly, we observed that IVIg did not inhibit, but instead stimulated,
spontaneous maturation and T-cell stimulatory ability of human DCs, while leaving
lipopolysaccharide-induced DC maturation and cytokine production unaffected.
Strikingly, prevention of IVIg binding to culture plate surface, or blocking of
the activating Fcγ receptor IIa on DC, abrogated the stimulatory effect of IVIg
on costimulatory molecule expression and on T-cell stimulatory capacity of DCs,
suggesting that IVIg activates DCs on IgG adsorption to the plastic surface. This
study warrants for careful study design when performing cell culture studies with
IVIg to prevent artifactual effects, and shows that IVIg does not modulate
directly costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production, or allogeneic
T-cell stimulatory capacity of human DCs.

University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China.

INTRODUCTION: The ability of B cells to negatively regulate cellular immune
responses and inflammation has been described. The regulatory B (Breg) cells with
the unique CD1d(hi)CD5(+)CD19(+) phenotype and the capacity to produce IL-10 are 
potent negative regulators of inflammation and autoimmunity in several in vivo
mouse models of autoimmune disease.
AIM: To investigate whether Breg cell deficiency participates in autoimmune
thyroiditis (AIT) in an animal model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-obese diabetic (NOD).H-2(h4) mice at 4 weeks of age
were randomly divided into control and iodine-treated groups; the iodine-treated 
group received sterile water containing 0.005 % NaI for 10 or 20 weeks. The
percentage of CD1d(hi)CD5(+)CD19(+) Bregs, CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T
cells (Treg) and CD4(+)IL17(+) T helper 17 cells (Th17) in splenic mononuclear
cells was detected by multicolor flow cytometry. The expression of IL-10 mRNA and
TGF-β mRNA in splenocytes was measured by real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: NOD.H-2(h4) mice spontaneously develop anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies
and intrathyroidal lymphocyte infiltration when supplied with iodine in drinking 
water. Mice with AIT had a decreased CD1d(hi)CD5(+)CD19(+) Breg subset and
reduced IL-10 mRNA expression in splenocytes compared with controls (p < 0.05)
and maintained relatively low levels during the development of thyroiditis. The
proportion of Breg cells was negatively correlated with the proportion of Th17
cells, but positively correlated with CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cells in
splenocytes (All p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The defective expression of Breg cells combined with impaired Treg
cells and enhanced Th17 cells might play an important role in the development of 
iodine-induced AIT in NOD.H-2(h4) mice.

BACKGROUND: Macrophages are crucial cells in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Macrophages are plastic cells which can switch from a classical pro-inflammatory 
M1 to an alternative anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype, depending on the 
environmental stimuli. Because high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels 
are inversely correlated to cardiovascular disease and since HDL displays
anti-inflammatory properties, we investigated whether HDL can affect alternative 
macrophage differentiation of primary human monocytes in the presence of
interleukin (IL)-4, a M2 macrophage polarization driver, in vitro and ex vivo.
METHODS AND RESULTS: M2 macrophages are highly responsive to HDL stimulation,
since the expression of pentraxin 3 (PTX3), a well known HDL target gene, is
induced by HDL more strongly in M2 macrophages than in control unpolarized
resting macrophages (RM). As expected, the expression of M2 markers, such as
Mannose Receptor (MR), CD200 Receptor (CD200R), Coagulation factor XIII A1
(F13A1), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and IL10, was induced in IL-4
polarized M2 macrophages compared to RM. However, incubation with HDL added in
vitro did not modulate the gene expression of M2 macrophage polarization markers.
Moreover, monocytes isolated from subjects with genetically low HDL levels,
carrying ABCA1 or LCAT mutations, differentiated ex vivo into M2 macrophages
without any difference in the alternative macrophage marker expression profile.
CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro and ex vivo results indicate that, contrary to mouse 
macrophages, HDL does not influence macrophage M2 polarization of human
monocyte-derived macrophages. Thus, the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL in
humans are probably not related to the enhancement of the M2 macrophage
phenotype.

Severe trauma renders patients susceptible to infection. In sepsis, defective
bacterial clearance has been linked to specific deviations in the innate immune
response. We hypothesized that innate immune modulations observed during sepsis
also contribute to increased bacterial susceptibility after severe trauma. A
well-established murine model of burn injury, used to replicate infection
following trauma, showed that wound inoculation with P. aeruginosa quickly
spreads systemically. The systemic IL-10/IL-12 axis was skewed after burn injury 
with infection as indicated by a significant elevation in serum IL-10 and
polarization of neutrophils into an anti-inflammatory ("N2"; IL-10(+) IL-12(-))
phenotype. Infection with an attenuated P. aeruginosa strain (ΔCyaB) was cleared 
better than the wildtype strain and was associated with an increased
pro-inflammatory neutrophil ("N1"; IL-10(-)IL-12(+)) response in burn mice. This 
suggests that neutrophil polarization influences bacterial clearance after burn
injury. Administration of a TLR5 agonist, flagellin, after burn injury restored
the neutrophil response towards a N1 phenotype resulting in an increased
clearance of wildtype P. aeruginosa after wound inoculation. This study details
specific alterations in innate cell populations after burn injury that contribute
to increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. In addition, for the first
time, it identifies neutrophil polarization as a therapeutic target for the
reversal of bacterial susceptibility after injury.

To design scaffolds for tissue regeneration, details of the host body reaction to
the scaffolds must be studied. Host body reactions have been investigated mainly 
by immunohistological observations for a long time. Despite of recent dramatic
development in genetic analysis technologies, genetically comprehensive changes
in host body reactions are hardly studied. There is no information about host
body reactions that can predict successful tissue regeneration in the future. In 
the present study, porous polyethylene scaffolds were coated with bioactive
collagen or bio-inert poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine-co-n-butyl
methacrylate) (PMB) and were implanted subcutaneously and compared the host body 
reaction to those substrates by normalizing the result using control non-coat
polyethylene scaffold. The comprehensive analyses of early host body reactions to
the scaffolds were carried out using a DNA microarray assay. Within numerous
genes which were expressed differently among these scaffolds, particular genes
related to inflammation, wound healing, and angiogenesis were focused upon.
Interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 are important cytokines in tissue responses to
biomaterials because IL-1β promotes both inflammation and wound healing and IL-10
suppresses both of them. IL-1β was up-regulated in the collagen-coated scaffold. 
Collagen-specifically up-regulated genes contained both M1- and
M2-macrophage-related genes. Marked vessel formation in the collagen-coated
scaffold was occurred in accordance with the up-regulation of many
angiogenesis-inducible factors. The DNA microarray assay provided global
information regarding the host body reaction. Interestingly, several up-regulated
genes were detected even on the very bio-inert PMB-coated surfaces and those
genes include inflammation-suppressive and wound healing-suppressive IL-10,
suggesting that not only active tissue response but also the inert response may
relates to these genetic regulations.

CD5 is a lymphoid-specific transmembrane glycoprotein constitutively expressed on
thymocytes and mature T and B1a lymphocytes. Current data support the view that
CD5 is a negative regulator of antigen-specific receptor-mediated signaling in
these cells, and that this would likely be achieved through interaction with CD5 
ligand/s (CD5L) of still undefined nature expressed on immune or accessory cells.
To determine the functional consequence of loss of CD5/CD5L interaction in vivo, 
a new transgenic mouse line was generated (shCD5EμTg), expressing a circulating
soluble form of human CD5 (shCD5) as a decoy to impair membrane-bound CD5
function. These shCD5EμTg mice showed an enhanced response to autologous
antigens, as deduced from the presentation of more severe forms of experimentally
inducible autoimmune disease (collagen-induced arthritis, CIA; and experimental
autoimmune encephalitis, EAE), as well as an increased anti-tumoral response in
non-orthotopic cancer models (B16 melanoma). This enhancement of the immune
response was in agreement with the finding of significantly reduced proportions
of spleen and lymph node Treg cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+), and of peritoneal
IL-10-producing and CD5+ B cells, as well as an increased proportion of spleen
NKT cells in shCD5EμTg mice. Similar changes in lymphocyte subpopulations were
observed in wild-type mice following repeated administration of exogenous
recombinant shCD5 protein. These data reveal the relevant role played by CD5/CD5L
interactions on the homeostasis of some functionally relevant lymphocyte
subpopulations and the modulation of immune responses to autologous antigens.

Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the use of
interventions that target the intestinal microbiota as a treatment approach for
asthma. This study is aimed at exploring the therapeutic effects of long-term
treatment with a combination of Bifidobacterium breve with non-digestible
oligosaccharides on airway inflammation and remodeling. A murine
ovalbumin-induced chronic asthma model was used. Pulmonary airway inflammation;
mRNA expression of pattern recognition receptors, Th-specific cytokines and
transcription factors in lung tissue; expression of Foxp3 in blood Th cells; in
vitro T cell activation; mast cell degranulation; and airway remodeling were
examined. The combination of B. breve with non-digestible oligosaccharides
suppressed pulmonary airway inflammation; reduced T cell activation and mast cell
degranulation; modulated expression of pattern recognition receptors, cytokines
and transcription factors; and reduced airway remodeling. The treatment induced
regulatory T cell responses, as shown by increased Il10 and Foxp3 transcription
in lung tissue, and augmented Foxp3 protein expression in blood CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T
cells. This specific combination of beneficial bacteria with non-digestible
oligosaccharides has strong anti-inflammatory properties, possibly via the
induction of a regulatory T cell response, resulting in reduced airway remodeling
and, therefore, may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic inflammation in
allergic asthma.

Although several components of the microbial wall of gram-positive bacteria and
fungi possess immunostimulatory properties, their pathogenetic role remains
incompletely evaluated. The purpose of this study was to assess the basic immune 
status of patients susceptible to infections and their capability for cytokine
production after stimulation with wall components of gram-positive bacteria and
fungi. We measured serum cytokine levels as well as cytokine production after ex 
vivo lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and mannan stimulation of whole blood. The blood was
taken from 10 healthy volunteers, 10 patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD), 10 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), and 10 patients on their 2nd day
of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), who suffered from non septic systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and had an APACHE II score ≥25. We used 1
μg/ml LTA and 100 μg/ml mannan for an incubation period of 8 h to stimulate 100
μl aliquots of whole blood. All patient groups had higher baseline values of
TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10 compared to the control group, but only for ICU
patients the difference was statistically significant. The ratio IL-10/IL-6 was
found 0.33, 0.22, and 0.96 in healthy persons, ESRD, and DM patients
respectively, and 1.32 in ICU patients. In all examined groups, the levels of
cytokines significantly increased after stimulation by LTA and mannan, although
in severely ill patients this change was considerably smaller, possibly
reflecting a state of monocytes' depression and relative hyporesponsiveness. No
significant differences between the LTA and the mannan stimulation were observed.

BACKGROUND: Although rat anti-mouse IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody (MR16-1) has
been reported to effectively ameliorate various tissue damages, its effect on
skeletal muscle regeneration has not been determined. Moreover, the localization,
persistence and duration of action of this reagent in damaged tissues after
systemic administration have not been assessed.
METHODS: The MR16-1 was administered i.p. immediately after cardiotoxin
(CTX)-induced muscle damage on mice.
RESULTS: MR16-1 administered i.p. was observed only to the damaged muscle. This
delivered MR16-1 was dramatically decreased from 3 to 7days post-injury
concomitantly with a reduction of IL-6R expression. This reduction of the MR16-1 
level in the damaged muscle was not rescued by additional administration of
MR16-1, suggesting the short half-life of MR16-1 was not the factor for the
remaining levels. In addition, a significant inhibitory effect of MR16-1 on
phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 was
observed in the macrophage-enriched area of damaged muscle 3days after injury.
Finally, the acceleration of muscle regeneration observed at day 7 post-injury
following MR16-1 treatment was associated with reduced expression of
fibrosis-related genes, such as interleukin-10 and arginase, in the infiltrated
macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MR16-1 which was found primarily
localized in infiltrated macrophages in the damaged muscle might facilitate
muscle regeneration via immune modulation.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are deemed to provide further insight into
the understanding not only of MR16-1 treatment on muscle regeneration, but also
of the other anti-cytokine treatment on the cytokine-related disease.

In mice a 50% calorie restriction (CR) for 28days attenuates sickness behavior
after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and these mice demonstrate a central
anti-inflammatory bias. This study examined the dose-dependent effect of CR on
sickness behavior (fever, anorexia, cachexia) and peripheral immune markers
post-LPS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats fed ad libitum or CR by 50% for 14, 21, or
28days were injected on day 15, 22, or 29 with 50μg/kg of LPS or saline
(1mL/500g). Changes in body temperature (Tb), locomotor activity, body weight,
and food intake were determined. A separate cohort of rats was fed ad libitum or 
CR by 50% for 28days and serum levels of corticosterone (CORT), interleukin 6
(IL-6), and IL-10 were determined at 0, 2, and 4h post-LPS. The rats CR for
28days demonstrated the largest attenuation of sickness behavior: no fever,
limited reduction in locomotor activity, no anorexia, and reduced cachexia
following LPS. Rats CR for 14 and 21days demonstrated a partial attenuation of
sickness behavior. Rats CR for 14days demonstrated a larger increase in Tb,
larger reduction in locomotor activity, and larger weight loss compared to rats
CR for 21days. Serum CORT was increased at 2h post-LPS in ad libitum and CR
groups; however it was two times larger in the CR animals. Levels of IL-6 were
significantly attenuated at 2h post-LPS in the CR animals. IL-10 levels were
similar post-LPS. CR results in an enhanced anti-inflammatory response in the
form of increased CORT and diminished pro-inflammatory signals.

Type I interferon plays opposing roles in cytotoxicity and interferon-γ
production by natural killer and CD8 T cells after influenza A virus infection in
mice.

University, Fukuoka, Japan.

Type I interferons (IFNs) promote natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T-cell
responses, which play a role not only in the resolution of infection but also in 
the induction of acute lung injury following influenza A virus infection. We show
here that IFN-α receptor knock-out (Ifnar1(-/-)) mice exhibited impaired
cytotoxic activity as well as an increased ability of NK and CD8(+) T cells to
produce IFN-γ after infection with influenza virus A/FM/1/47 (H1N1, a
mouse-adapted strain). A deficiency in IFNAR signaling significantly impaired
IL-10 production in influenza virus-infected lungs and enhanced IFN-γ production 
by NK cells, which were suppressed by exogenous IL-10. Depletion of NK cells but 
not CD8(+) T cells in Ifnar1(-/-) mice improved the survival rate after A/FM/1/47
infection, indicating that NK cells are responsible for acute lung injury in
Ifnar1(-/-) mice following influenza A virus infection, although the depletion of
IFN-γ did not improve the outcome. Thus, type I IFN signaling plays a role not
only in the upregulation of cytotoxicity but also in the downregulation of some
effector mechanisms including IFN-γ production by NK and CD8(+) T cells via IL-10
production.

Effect of intensive atorvastatin therapy on periprocedural PDCD4 expression in
CD4+ T lymphocytes of patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous
coronary intervention.

University, Nanning, PR China.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of intensive atorvastatin therapy on
programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) expression by CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with
unstable angina who received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: Patients with unstable angina were randomized to pretreatment with
either an intensive dose (80 mg/day, n = 33) or a conventional dose (20 mg/day, n
= 33) of atorvastatin. Circulating CD4+ T cells were subsequently obtained prior 
to PCI, and also 18-24 h after PCI, using a magnetic cell sorting system.
Fluorescence-based quantitative real-time PCR was then used to measure levels of 
PDCD4 mRNA in the isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes, and Western blot analysis was used
to detect levels of PDCD4. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and TNF-α were
quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
RESULTS: Of the 66 patients with unstable angina that were examined, levels of
PDCD4 mRNA and protein were found to dramatically decrease in patients who
received an intensive dose of atorvastatin following PCI (p < 0.05). In contrast,
serum levels of TNF-α significantly increased following PCI in both the intensive
dose group and the conventional dose group, with the latter being higher than the
former (p < 0.05). Serum IL-10 levels also markedly increased following PCI for
the two groups. However, higher values were associated with the intensive dose
group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive atorvastatin treatment reduced the post-PCI myocardial
inflammatory response in patients with unstable angina, possibly by inhibiting
PDCD4 expression in CD4+ T lymphocytes.

A contiguous intestinal epithelial barrier safeguards against aberrant activation
of the immune system and therefore requires molecular mechanisms that ensure
effective wound-healing responses. During this processes cytokine-producing
myeloid cells serve as rheostats that link the degree of wounding and local
inflammation to the epithelial repair response. Likewise, intestinal inflammation
is an important factor by which the microenvironment promotes tumorigenesis and
the progression of established cancers by facilitating neoplastic cell survival
and proliferation. Among the cytokines and chemokines orchestrating this process,
those comprising the interleukin (IL) IL6, IL10/IL22 and IL17/IL23 families play 
a prominent role by virtue of converging on the latent Signal Transducer and
Activator of Transcription (Stat)-3. Accordingly, aberrant and persistent Stat3
activation is a frequent observation in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract
where it promotes "cancer hallmark capabilities" in the malignant epithelium and 
suppresses the anti-tumor response of innate and adaptive immune cells. Here, we 
discuss recent insights arising from situations where persistent activation of
the gp130/Stat3 signaling cascades result from excessive abundance of IL6 family 
cytokines. In particular, we highlight novel and unique roles for IL11 in
promoting intestinal wound-healing and, in its corrupted form, enabling and
facilitating growth of inflammation-associated and sporadic gastrointestinal
tumors.

Aging is associated with increased circulating pro-inflammatory and lower
anti-inflammatory cytokines. Exercise training, in addition to improving muscle
function, reduces these circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Yet, few studies 
have evaluated changes in the expression of cytokines within skeletal muscle
after exercise training. The aim of the current study was to examine the
expression of cytokines both at rest and following a bout of isokinetic exercise 
performed before and after 12weeks of resistance exercise training in young (n=8,
20.3±0.8yr) and elderly men (n=8, 66.9±1.6yr). Protein expression of various
cytokines was determined in muscle homogenates. The expression of MCP-1, IL-8 and
IL-6 (which are traditionally classified as 'pro-inflammatory') increased
substantially after acute exercise. By contrast, the expression of the
anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 increased only slightly (or not
at all) after acute exercise. These responses were not significantly different
between young and elderly men, either before or after 12weeks of exercise
training. However, compared with the young men, the expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines 2h post exercise tended to be greater in the elderly
men prior to training. Training attenuated this difference. These data suggest
that the inflammatory response to unaccustomed exercise increases with age.
Furthermore, regular exercise training may help to normalize this inflammatory
response, which could have important implications for muscle regeneration and
adaptation in the elderly.

There is emerging evidence that stem cells can rejuvenate damaged cells by
mitochondrial transfer. Earlier studies show that epithelial mitochondrial
dysfunction is critical in asthma pathogenesis. Here we show for the first time
that Miro1, a mitochondrial Rho-GTPase, regulates intercellular mitochondrial
movement from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to epithelial cells (EC). We
demonstrate that overexpression of Miro1 in MSC (MSCmiro(Hi)) leads to enhanced
mitochondrial transfer and rescue of epithelial injury, while Miro1 knockdown
(MSCmiro(Lo)) leads to loss of efficacy. Treatment with MSCmiro(Hi) was
associated with greater therapeutic efficacy, when compared to control MSC, in
mouse models of rotenone (Rot) induced airway injury and allergic airway
inflammation (AAI). Notably, airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling were
reversed by MSCmiro(Hi) in three separate allergen-induced asthma models. In a
human in vitro system, MSCmiro(Hi) reversed mitochondrial dysfunction in
bronchial epithelial cells treated with pro-inflammatory supernatant of
IL-13-induced macrophages. Anti-inflammatory MSC products like NO, TGF-β, IL-10
and PGE2, were unchanged by Miro1 overexpression, excluding non-specific
paracrine effects. In summary, Miro1 overexpression leads to increased stem cell 
repair.

BACKGROUND: In models of COPD, environmental stressors induce innate immune
responses, inflammasome activation and inflammation. However, the interaction
between these responses and their role in driving pulmonary inflammation in
stable COPD is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the activation of innate immunity and inflammasome
pathways in the bronchial mucosa and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients
with stable COPD of different severity and control healthy smokers and
non-smokers.
METHODS: Innate immune mediators (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-27, IL-37, 
thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interferon γ and their receptors, STAT1 and 
pSTAT1) and inflammasome components (NLRP3, NALP7, caspase 1, IL-1β and its
receptors, IL-18, IL-33, ST2) were measured in the bronchial mucosa using
immunohistochemistry. IL-6, soluble IL-6R, sgp130, IL-7, IL-27, HMGB1, IL-33,
IL-37 and soluble ST2 were measured in BAL using ELISA.
RESULTS: In bronchial biopsies IL-27+ and pSTAT1+ cells are increased in patients
with severe COPD compared with control healthy smokers. IL-7+ cells are increased
in patients with COPD and control smokers compared with control non-smokers. In
severe stable COPD IL-7R+, IL-27R+ and TSLPR+ cells are increased in comparison
with both control groups. The NALP3 inflammasome is not activated in patients
with stable COPD compared with control subjects. The inflammasome inhibitory
molecules NALP7 and IL-37 are increased in patients with COPD compared with
control smokers. IL-6 levels are increased in BAL from patients with stable COPD 
compared with control smokers with normal lung function whereas IL-1β and IL-18
were similar across all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of IL-27, IL-37 and NALP7 in the bronchial
mucosa may be involved in progression of stable COPD.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 supernatant (GR-1SN) on secretion profiles
of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors from primary cultures of human
decidual cells. Lipopolysaccharide significantly increased the output of
proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1B, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-15,
IL-17A, interferon gamma [IFN-γ], and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]);
anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1RN, IL-4, IL-9, and IL-10); chemokines (IL-8,
eotaxin, IFN-inducible protein 10 [IP-10], monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
[MCP-1], macrophage inflammatory protein-1α [MIP-1α], macrophage inflammatory
protein-1β [MIP-1β], and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and
secreted [RANTES]); and growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
[CSF] 3, CSF-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGFA]). Lactobacillus 
rhamnosus GR-1SN alone significantly increased CSF-3, MIP-1α MIP-1β, and RANTES
but decreased IL-15 and IP-10 output. The GR-1SN also significantly or partially 
reduced LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2 IL-6,
IL-12p70, IL-15, IL-17, and IP-10; partially reduced LPS-induced
anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1RN, IL-4 and IL-10, and LPS-induced VEGFA output 
but did not affect CSF-3, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1, IL-8, and IL-9. Our results
demonstrate that GR-1SN attenuates the inflammatory responses to LPS by human
decidual cells, suggesting its potential role in ameliorating intrauterine
infection.

SGK-1 regulates inflammation and cell death in the ischemic-reperfused heart:
pressure-related effects.

BACKGROUND: Systemic hypertension and the associated increased myocardial
load/mechanical stress are common in patients with coronary heart disease. Thus, 
unraveling of mechanosensitive molecular mechanisms that determine cell fate in
the setting of cardiac tissue injury is of scientific and clinical relevance. We 
tested the hypothesis that the prosurvival, mechanosensitive, serum
glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK-1) is a pivotal determinant of
pressure-related inflammatory response and cell fate in the ischemic-reperfused
heart.
METHODS: Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were subjected to an ischemia
reperfusion (IR) insult, at 80 or 160cm water, with perfusate lacking or
containing the SGK-1 inhibitor GSK650394A (1 μM); normoxic hearts served as
controls. Thereafter, hearts tissues were used for Western blotting or cardiac
cells were prepared for flow cytometry and immunofluorescent studies.
RESULTS: An IR insult (i) reduced phosphoSGK-1 (active and protective) in
association with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (ψm) and
increased apoptosis and necrosis and (ii) increased expressions of growth-arrest 
and DNA damage-associated protein 153 (GADD153; a determinant of inflammation and
cell death) and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 17; these effects
were greater at high pressure. On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory cytokines
IL-10 and IL-27 increased more in ischemic-reperfused hearts subjected to low
pressure. SGK-1 inhibition further reduced phosphoSGK-1, increased GADD153 and
IL-17, and reduced IL-10 and IL-27 in association with augmented disruption of ψm
and exacerbated cell death; these effects were greater at low pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a major pressure-related role for SGK-1 in
regulating inflammation and cell fate in the ischemic-reperfused heart.

OBJECTIVES: Previous genome-wide association studies have demonstrated an
association between the IL-10 region and Behçet's disease (BD) in Turkish and
Japanese populations. Our aim was to fully examine the relationship between IL-10
and BD, the associations between BD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
IL-10-mediated signalling pathways (JAK1, TYK2, and STAT3) were examined in
Korean patients with BD.
METHODS: DNA samples were obtained from 223 patients who met the international
study group criteria for BD and from 222 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
Twenty-four tag SNPs in JAK1, STAT3, and TYK2 were selected for genotyping based 
on the Japanese panel of international HapMap data with a minor allele frequency 
>5% and r2 >0.8.
RESULTS: The allele-based analysis showed that the T allele of rs310245 in JAK1
was associated with BD (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.34 [1.03-1.76], 
p=0.031), which lost statistical significance after permutation-based correction 
for multiple testing. In the genotype-based analysis, the JAK1 rs310245 TT
homozygote (1.79 [1.14-2.82], p=0.012) and the STAT3 rs2293152 GG homozygote
(2.01 [1.16-3.47], p=0.011) showed associations with BD. However, these
associations did not achieve significance after correction for multiple testing. 
We did not observe any genetic interaction between the JAK1 rs310245 TT
homozygote and the STAT3 rs2293152 GG homozygote. In the haplotype analysis, GT
haplotype at rs17127024 and rs310245 (1.34 [1.03-1.74], p=0.032), and the AA
haplotype at rs2256298 and rs3818753 (1.41 [1.03-1.92], p=0.034) in JAK1 were
associated with BD, but lost statistical significance after correction for
multiple testing.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant association between BD and SNPs in
IL-10-mediated intracellular signalling in Korean patients.

BACKGROUND: Numbers of CD8(+) T cells expressing the leukotriene B4 (LTB4)
receptor, BLT1, have been correlated with asthma severity.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the activation and numbers of BLT1-expressing peripheral
blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from patients with steroid-sensitive (SS) and
steroid-resistant (SR) asthma.
METHODS: CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells isolated from peripheral blood of healthy
human subjects and patients with SS and SR asthma were stimulated in culture with
anti-CD3/anti-CD28 followed by analysis of BLT1 surface expression and cytokine
production. Activation of CD8(+) T cells after ligation of BLT1 by LTB4 was
monitored by changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations.
RESULTS: The number of BLT1-expressing cells was larger in patients with asthma
than in controls and larger on activated CD8(+) than on CD4(+) T cells. Addition 
of LTB4 to activated CD8(+) T cells resulted in increases in intracellular Ca(2+)
concentrations. Expansion of activated CD4(+) T cells, unlike CD8(+) T cells, was
significantly decreased in the presence of corticosteroid. In patients with SS
asthma, numbers of BLT1-expressing CD8(+) T cells were lower in the presence of
corticosteroid, unlike in those with SR asthma in whom cell expansion was
maintained. Levels of interleukin-13 were highest in cultured CD8(+) T cells,
whereas interleukin-10 levels were higher in CD4(+) T cells from controls and
patients with SS asthma. Interferon-γ levels were lowest in patients with SR
asthma.
CONCLUSION: Differences in BLT1 expression, steroid sensitivity, and cytokine
production were demonstrated in T lymphocytes from patients with SS and SR
asthma. The LTB4-BLT1 pathway in CD8(+) cells may play an important role in
asthma and serve as an important target in the treatment of patients with SR
asthma.

IL-4 contributes to failure, and colludes with IL-10 to exacerbate Leishmania
donovani infection following administration of a subcutaneous leishmanial antigen
vaccine.

Author information:

Biology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. nali@iicb.res.in.

BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania
donovani complex is a potentially fatal disease if left untreated. Few treatment 
options exist and are toxic, costly and ineffective against resistant strains.
Thus a safe and efficacious vaccine to combat this disease is needed. Previously,
we reported that intraperitoneal administration of leishmanial antigens (LAg)
entrapped in liposomes conferred protection to BALB/c mice against L. donovani
challenge infection. However, this vaccine failed to protect mice when
administered subcutaneously. We therefore evaluated whether formulation of LAg in
combination with two commonly used human-compatible adjuvants, alum and saponin, 
could improve the protective efficacy of subcutaneously administered LAg, to a
level comparable to that of the intraperitoneal liposomal vaccination.
RESULTS: Vaccine formulations of LAg with alum or saponin failed to reduce
parasite burden in the liver, and alum + LAg immunized mice also failed to reduce
parasite burden in the spleen. Interestingly, saponin + LAg vaccination actually 
resulted in an increased L. donovani parasitic load in the spleen following L.
donovani challenge, suggesting this regimen exacerbates the infection. In
contrast, mice immunized intraperitoneally with Lip + LAg demonstrated
significant protection in both liver and spleen, as expected. Mechanistically, we
found that failure of alum + LAg to protect mice was associated with elevated
levels of IL-4, whereas both IL-4 and IL-10 levels were increased in saponin +
LAg immunized mice. This outcome served to exacerbate L. donovani infection in
the saponin + LAg group, despite a concurrent increase in proinflammatory IFN-γ
production. On the contrary, protection against L. donovani challenge in Lip +
LAg immunized mice was associated with elevated levels of IFN-γ in conjunction
with low levels of IL-4 and IL-10 production.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that elevated levels of IL-4 may contribute 
to LAg vaccine failure, whereas combined elevation of IL-4 together with IL-10
exacerbated the disease as observed in saponin + LAg immunized mice. In contrast,
a robust IFN-γ response, in the absence of IL-4 and IL-10 production, was
associated with protective immunity following administration of the Lip + LAg
vaccine. Together these findings suggest that optimization of antigen/adjuvant
formulations to minimize IL-4 and IL-10 induction may be helpful in the
development of high efficacy vaccines targeting Leishmania.

University, Chongqing, China.

BACKGROUND: Activation and infiltration of T cells and macrophages are key
features of renal tubulointerstitial injury. The costimulatory molecule V-set and
immunoglobulin domain-containing protein-4 (VSIG4), which is exclusively
expressed on macrophages, is capable of inhibiting the T cell response. However, 
it is unclear whether VSIG4 is involved in renal tubulointerstitial injury. This 
study was designed to investigate the role of VSIG4 in renal tubulointerstitial
injury and the related T cell infiltration.
METHODS: The unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) model of renal inflammation
and tubulointerstitial fibrosis was established in VSIG4 transgenic knock-out
C57BL/6 mice (VSIG4(-/-)) and wild-type C57BL/6 mice (VSIG4(+/+)). Comparative
analysis of renal biological indices were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR 
and immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: Both the VSIG4(-/-) and VSIG4(+/+) mice showed UUO-related temporal
changes in renal expression of CD3, CD4 and CD8 T cell markers, with the protein 
levels being significantly lower in the VSIG4(+/+) UUO mice. Moreover, at each
time point examined the UUO VSIG4(+/+) mice showed significantly lower renal mRNA
levels of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, interferon- and tumor necrosis
factor-, but significantly higher IL-10, than the UUO VSIG4(-/-) mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The macrophage-expressed VSIG4 may act to alleviate renal
tubulointerstitial injury via inhibition of T cell infiltration and secretion of 
inflammation related factors.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery in infants results in a profound inflammatory
response secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the need for blood
products. It is not clear how this inflammatory response modulates postoperative 
course or whether quantification of proinflammatory cytokines can aid with risk
stratification. In this study, we prospectively assessed a panel of candidate
markers to determine the time course for inflammation and the association of
specific markers with clinical outcomes defined as intensive care unit length of 
stay (LOS).
METHODS: We obtained preoperative blood samples from 92 neonates undergoing
surgery with CPB and then serially for 5 days after surgery. Numerous
interleukins were assayed along with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and
interferon (INF)-gamma. The most common surgical procedures were arterial switch 
procedure (n = 35) and Norwood operation (n = 34). Multivariate analysis was
performed to determine if inflammatory mediators could independently predict
prolonged intensive care unit LOS.
RESULTS: Compared with the presurgery level, there were statistically significant
increases (p < 0.005) for 8 out of 11 inflammatory markers: INF-gamma,
interleukin (IL)-10, IL-13, IL-2, IL-5, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 after surgery. 
The only cytokine on the first postoperative day that was independently
associated with prolonged length of stay was IL-8 (p = 0.002). Cytokine values
measured on postoperative day 3 were most valuable in predicting prolonged LOS. A
model that included use of circulatory arrest, and day 3 measures of IL-6 and
IL-8 yielded an area under of the curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 
0.96) for predicting a prolonged LOS.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, neonatal heart surgery for complex lesions elicits a
broad inflammatory response. This early inflammatory response appears nonspecific
and did not predict clinical course. Persistence of specific inflammatory
mediators on the third day after surgery, however, provided important prognostic 
information. As such, select cytokines may serve as valuable biomarkers in this
population. Whether strategies targeting specific cytokines can alter clinical
course is not known.

INTRODUCTION: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections can cause hand, foot, and mouth
disease (HFMD), which is a potentially fatal illness in children. Epidemics of
HFMD are seen every year globally and present an increasing threat to public
health worldwide.
METHODOLOGY: To identify potential severity markers for severe HFMD, laboratory
findings and levels of eight serum cytokines in 143 EV71-infected patients in
Beijing You'an Hospital were analyzed. Patients were grouped by disease severity:
Mild (no severe complications) (n = 59), isolated isolated brainstem encephalitis
(BE) (n = 47), isolated pulmonary edema (PE) (n = 12), and BE+PE (n = 25).
RESULTS: IL-8 levels peaked at day one after admission and were found to be
correlated to disease severity, maximal body temperature, and length of hospital 
stay. Among all tested cytokines, IL-8 was correlated to only IL-6 (p = 0.010).
IL-6 and IL-10 were elevated in most patients (98.6% and 70.6%), but not
correlated to disease severity (both p > 0.05). IFNγ was only negatively
correlated to mild cases (p = 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 was correlated to disease severity of HFMD. IL-6 and IL-10,
although elevated in most HFMD patients, were not correlated to disease severity.

PURPOSE: Increasing research suggests that inflammation mediates symptom
development. In this longitudinal study, we examined inflammatory factors related
to the development of high symptom burden during autologous hematopoietic stem
cell transplant (AuSCT) for multiple myeloma.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n = 63) repeatedly reported symptom severity on
the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory multiple myeloma module (MDASI-MM) and
contributed blood samples periodically for up to 100 days after AuSCT for
inflammatory marker assays. The temporal associations between serum inflammatory 
marker concentrations and symptom severity outcomes were examined by nonlinear
mixed-effect modeling.
RESULTS: Fatigue, pain, disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, and drowsiness were
consistently the most severe MDASI-MM symptoms during the study. Peak symptom
severity occurred on day 8 after AuSCT, during white blood cell count nadir.
Patterns of serum interleukin (IL)-6 (peak on day 9) and soluble IL-6 receptor
(sIL-6R; nadir on day 8) expression paralleled symptom development over time
(both P < 0.0001). By univariate analysis, serum IL-6, sIL-6R, IL-10, C-reactive 
protein, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, sIL-1R2, sIL-1RA, and soluble 
tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 were significantly related to the most severe
symptoms during the first 30 days after AuSCT (all P < 0.05). By multivariate
analysis, IL-6 (estimate = 0.170; P = 0.004) and MIP-1α (estimate = -0.172; P =
0.006) were temporally associated with the severity of the component symptom
score.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammatory response was associated with high symptom
burden during the acute phase of AuSCT. Additional research is needed to
understand how the inflammatory response is mechanistically associated with
symptom expression and whether suppression of this response can reduce symptoms
without compromising tumor control.

The present study was conducted to determine whether dietary threonine
supplementation can improve immunity of weaned pigs challenged by swine
Pseudorabies live vaccine (SPLV). Thirty crossbred piglets weaned at 21 days of
age were randomly assigned to three groups receiving diets containing true ileal 
digestible threonine (TIDT) at 0.74, 0.89 and 1.11% for 14 days. On day 8, all
pigs were injected intramuscularly with SPLV or sterile 0.9% NaCl solution. SPLV 
injection enhanced serum IgA, IgM, IgG, IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-10
concentrations (p < 0.05) and stimulated the relative mRNA abundance of Toll-like
receptors (TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9) in different tissues (p < 0.05). Under no
challenge, increasing dietary TIDT levels enhanced serum IgG (p < 0.05), IgM
(p = 0.07) and IFN-γ (p < 0.05) concentration, tended to decrease serum IL-1β,
TNF-α and IL-10 concentration, and regulated relative mRNA abundance of TLR3,
TLR7 or TLR9 in different tissues (p < 0.05). However, there was a synergistic
role for increasing the serum IL-10 concentration between dietary TIDT levels and
SPLV injection (p < 0.05). Under SPLV challenge, increasing dietary TIDT levels
attenuated the increase of the serum IFN-γ concentration, and the increase of the
relative mRNA abundance of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 in the different tissues
(p < 0.05). These results suggest that an appropriate dietary threonine
supplementation could improve the immune status of weaned pigs injected with SPLV
by down-regulating the expression of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 in tissues, and thus
regulating T-helper cytokine secretion.

BACKGROUND: Unprotected intercourse and seminal discharge are powerful activators
of the mucosal immune system and are important risk factors for transmission of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study was designed to determine if
female sex work is associated with changes in the mucosal immunity.
METHODS: Cervicovaginal lavage and plasma from 122 HIV-uninfected female sex
workers (FSW) and 44 HIV-uninfected low-risk non-FSW from the same socioeconomic 
district of Nairobi were analyzed for evidence of immune activation (IA). The
cervico-mononuclear cells (CMC) were analyzed for cellular activation by flow
cytometry.
RESULTS: Lower IA was observed in FSW compared to the low-risk women as
demonstrated by the lower level of MIP-3α (P < .001), ITAC (P < .001), MIG
(p.0001), IL-1α (P < .001), IL-1β (P < .001), IL-1Rα (P = .0002), IL-6 (P <
.001), IL-8 (P < .001), IL-10 (P = .01), IP-10 (P = .0001), MDC (P < .001),
MIP-1α, (P < .001), MIP-1β (P = .005), MCP-1 (P = .03), and TNF-α (P = .006).
Significant differences were noted as early as 1 year following initiation of sex
work and increased with duration of sex work.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that sex work is associated with important changes 
in the mucosal immune system. By analyzing chemokine/cytokine levels and CMC
activation, we observed a lower mucosal IA in HIV-uninfected FSW compared to
low-risk women.

Serum-mediated activation of macrophages reflects TcVac2 vaccine efficacy against
Chagas disease.

Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA.

Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in 
the United States. No effective treatments are available. The TcG1, TcG2, and
TcG4 antigens are highly conserved in clinically relevant Trypanosoma cruzi
isolates and are recognized by B and T cells in infected hosts. Delivery of these
antigens as a DNA prime/protein boost vaccine (TcVac2) elicited lytic antibodies 
and type 1 CD8(+) T cells that expanded upon challenge infection and provided
>90% control of parasite burden and myocarditis in chagasic mice. Here we
determined if peripheral blood can be utilized to capture the TcVac2-induced
protection from Chagas disease. We evaluated the serum levels of T. cruzi
kinetoplast DNA (TckDNA), T. cruzi 18S ribosomal DNA (Tc18SrDNA), and murine
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as indicators of parasite persistence and tissue damage
and monitored the effect of sera on macrophage phenotype. Circulating
TckDNA/Tc18SrDNA and mtDNA were decreased by >3- to 5-fold and 2-fold,
respectively, in vaccinated infected mice compared to nonvaccinated infected
mice. Macrophages incubated with sera from vaccinated infected mice exhibited M2 
surface markers (CD16, CD32, CD200, and CD206), moderate proliferation, a low
oxidative/nitrosative burst, and a regulatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine response
(interleukin-4 [IL-4] plus IL-10 > tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]). In
comparison, macrophages incubated with sera from nonvaccinated infected mice
exhibited M1 surface markers, vigorous proliferation, a substantial
oxidative/nitrosative burst, and a proinflammatory cytokine response (TNF-α ≫
IL-4 plus IL-10). Cardiac infiltration of macrophages and TNF-α and oxidant
levels were significantly reduced in TcVac2-immunized chagasic mice. We conclude 
that circulating TcDNA and mtDNA levels and macrophage phenotype mediated by
serum constituents reflect in vivo levels of parasite persistence, tissue damage,
and inflammatory/anti-inflammatory state and have potential utility in evaluating
disease severity and efficacy of vaccines and drug therapies.

Helicobacter pylori membrane vesicles stimulate innate pro- and anti-inflammatory
responses and induce apoptosis in Jurkat T cells.

Persistent Helicobacter pylori infection induces chronic inflammation in the
human gastric mucosa, which is associated with development of peptic ulceration, 
gastric atrophy, and gastric adenocarcinoma. It has been postulated that
secretion of immunomodulatory molecules by H. pylori facilitates bacterial
persistence, and membrane vesicles (MV), which have the potential to cross the
gastric epithelial barrier, may mediate delivery of these molecules to host
immune cells. However, bacterial MV effects on human immune cells remain largely 
uncharacterized to date. In the present study, we investigated the
immunomodulatory effects of H. pylori MV with and without the vacuolating
cytotoxin, VacA, which inhibits human T cell activity. We show a high degree of
variability in the toxin content of vesicles between two H. pylori strains (SS1
and 60190). Vesicles from the more toxigenic 60190 strain contain more VacA (s1i1
type) than vesicles from the SS1 strain (s2i2 VacA), but engineering the SS1
strain to produce s1i1 VacA did not increase the toxin content of its vesicles.
Vesicles from all strains tested, including a 60190 isogenic mutant null for
VacA, strongly induced interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-6 production by human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells independently of the infection status of the
donor. Finally, we show that H. pylori MV induce T cell apoptosis and that this
is enhanced by, but not completely dependent on, the carriage of VacA. Together, 
these findings suggest a role for H. pylori MV in the stimulation of innate pro- 
and anti-inflammatory responses and in the suppression of T cell immunity.

Lactoferrin (LF) plays an important role in the body's immune system. However,
the immunomodulatory effects of supplementation transgenic cow's milk containing 
recombinant human LF (rhLF) on the systemic and intestinal immune systems in
infants remain unclear. Our laboratory has used genetic engineer to produce
transgenic cow secreted rhLF. To assess the immune responses we took piglets as
an animal model for infants. Eighteen piglets at 7 days of age were fed ordinary 
milk, 1:1 mix of ordinary and rhLF milk, or rhLF milk (LFM) for 30 days. The
incidence of diarrhea in piglets in natural condition was observed. The protein
abundances of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, IgM, IgE, histamine, interleukin
(IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 interferon, tumor necrosis factor
in the plasma, spleen or intestine were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. Intestinal structure was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin. The mRNA
levels of immune and allergy-related genes were measured by quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that LFM-fed
significantly reduced incidence of diarrhea, enhanced humoral immunity, T helper 
(Th) 1, and Th2 cell responses, improved the structure of the intestinal mucosal 
and did not induce food allergy. LFM increased mRNA levels of toll-like receptor 
2 and nuclear factor-κB p65 and decreased that of FCεRI β. In conclusion,
rhLF-enriched formula could improve systematic and intestinal immune responses
and did not elicit food allergies in neonatal piglets.

with oral lichen planus.

OBJECTIVE: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have emerged as important mediators in
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We investigated the possible involvement of
Tregs in oral lichen planus (OLP) and the influence of clinical therapy
(hydroxychloroquine and prednisone) on the frequencies of Tregs in OLP patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty patients diagnosed with OLP were the
study cohort. Levels of Tregs in blood and tissues were detected using flow
cytometry and immunostaining, respectively. Cytokine production was assessed
using a proteome profiler array and determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. mRNA expression of transcription factors was detected by real-time
quantitative PCR. Hydroxychloroquine or prednisone was used to treat patients
randomly. The frequency of Tregs was detected before treatment and 2 weeks after 
treatment.
RESULTS: Compared with healthy volunteers, OLP patients had a higher proportion
of Tregs in serum and tissues before treatment (P < 0.001). Serum concentrations 
of interleukin (IL)-8, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-10 were
significantly higher in patients than those in healthy controls. mRNA expression 
of Treg-related genes, including TGF-β, IL-10, signal transducer and activator of
transcription 6, and GATA binding protein 3, were upregulated significantly in
OLP patients. The frequency of Tregs was downregulated after hydroxychloroquine
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Tregs may contribute to the
immunopathogenesis of OLP and may provide a new therapeutic target for OLP
treatment.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: T cell-mediated immune dysfunction may have a crucial role in
OLP development. However, T helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 imbalance does not appear to be
sufficient to understand the pathogenesis of OLP. This is the first study to show
that Tregs are involved in the immunopathogenesis of OLP.

Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a member of IL-10 family cytokines that is produced by 
many different types of lymphocytes including both those of the innate and
adaptive immune systems. This includes activated T cells, most notably Th17 and
Th22 cells, and NK cells, γδ T cells, LTi cells and LTi-like cells. IL-22
mediates its effects via the IL-22-IL-22R complex and subsequent Janus
kinase-signal transducer and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling
pathway. Recently accumulated evidence has indicated that IL-22 also plays an
important role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. In this review,
we discuss the recent findings and advancement of the role for IL-22 in several
autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hepatitis,
graft versus host disease (GHVD) and allergic diseases, implicating that target
IL-22 may have a therapeutic potential in those autoimmune diseases.

HIV replication is only partially controlled by HIV-specific activated effector T
cells in chronic HIV infection and strategies are warranted to improve their
efficacy. Chronic T cell activation is generally accompanied by regulation of
antigen-specific T cell responses which may impair an effective control of
chronic infections. The impact of HIV-induced T cell regulation on individual
patients' disease progression is largely unknown, since classical T cell
activation assays reflect net activation with regulation as unknown contributing 
factor. We here explore a quantitative parameter for antigen-induced
cytokine-mediated regulation (R(AC) of HIV-specific effector T cell activation by
functional antibody-blockade of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β. HIV Env- 
and Gag-specific T cell activation and R(AC) were estimated in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from 30 treatment-naïve asymptomatic HIV-infected progressors
(CD4 count 472/µl, HIV RNA 37500 copies/ml) stimulated with overlapping peptide
panels for 6 days. R(AC) was estimated from differences in T cell activation
between normal and blocked cultures, and related to annual CD4 loss, immune
activation (CD38) and microbial translocation (plasma lipopolysaccharides). R(AC)
was heterogeneously distributed between individual patients and the two HIV
antigens. Notably, RAC did not correlate to corresponding classical activation.
Env R(AC) correlated with CD38 and CD4 loss rates (r> = 0.37, p = <0.046) whereas
classical Gag activation tended to correlate with HIV RNA (r = -0.35, p = 0.06). 
14 patients (47%) with low R(AC)'s to both Env and Gag had higher CD8 counts
(p = 0.014) and trends towards lower annual CD4 loss (p = 0.056) and later start 
with antiretroviral treatment (p = 0.07) than the others. In contrast, patients
with high RAC to both Env and Gag (n = 8) had higher annual CD4 loss (p = 0.034) 
and lower CD8 counts (p = 0.014). R(AC) to Env and Gag was not predicted by
classical activation parameters and may thus provide additional information on
HIV-specific immunity. R(AC) and other assessments of regulation deserve further 
in-depth exploration.

Although evidence suggests that T cells are critical for immunity to malaria,
reliable T cell correlates of exposure to and protection from malaria among
children living in endemic areas are lacking. We used multiparameter flow
cytometry to perform a detailed functional characterization of malaria-specific T
cells in 78 four-year-old children enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study in
Tororo, Uganda, a highly malaria-endemic region. More than 1800 episodes of
malaria were observed in this cohort, with no cases of severe malaria. We
quantified production of IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-10 (alone or in combination) by
malaria-specific T cells, and analyzed the relationship of this response to past 
and future malaria incidence. CD4(+) T cell responses were measurable in nearly
all children, with the majority of children having CD4(+) T cells producing both 
IFNγ and IL-10 in response to malaria-infected red blood cells. Frequencies of
IFNγ/IL10 co-producing CD4(+) T cells, which express the Th1 transcription factor
T-bet, were significantly higher in children with ≥2 prior episodes/year compared
to children with <2 episodes/year (P<0.001) and inversely correlated with
duration since malaria (Rho = -0.39, P<0.001). Notably, frequencies of IFNγ/IL10 
co-producing cells were not associated with protection from future malaria after 
controlling for prior malaria incidence. In contrast, children with <2 prior
episodes/year were significantly more likely to exhibit antigen-specific
production of TNFα without IL-10 (P = 0.003). While TNFα-producing CD4(+) T cells
were not independently associated with future protection, the absence of cells
producing this inflammatory cytokine was associated with the phenotype of
asymptomatic infection. Together these data indicate that the functional
phenotype of the malaria-specific T cell response is heavily influenced by
malaria exposure intensity, with IFNγ/IL10 co-producing CD4(+) T cells dominating
this response among highly exposed children. These CD4(+) T cells may play
important modulatory roles in the development of antimalarial immunity.

Posttranscriptional machinery regulates inflammation and is associated with
autoimmunity as well as tumorigenesis in collaboration with transcription
factors. We previously identified the tumor suppressor gene transformed
follicular lymphoma (TFL) on 6q25 in a patient with follicular lymphoma, which
transformed into diffuse large B cell lymphoma. TFL families have a common RNase 
domain that governs macrophage-mediated inflammation. In human peripheral blood, 
TFL is dominantly expressed at the glycine- and tryptophan-rich cytoplasmic
processing bodies of T lymphocytes, and it is persistently upregulated in
activated T cells. To address its physiological role, we established TFL(-/-)
mice in which TFL(-/-) lymphocytes proliferated more rapidly than TFL(+/+) upon
stimulation with inappropriate cytokine secretion, including IL-2, IL-6, and
IL-10. Moreover, TFL inhibited the synthesis of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6,
IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-17a by 3' untranslated region RNA degradation. Experimental 
autoimmune encephalitis induced in TFL(-/-) mice demonstrated persistent severe
paralysis. CNS-infiltrated CD4(+) T cells in TFL(-/-) mice contained a higher
proportion of Th17 cells than did those in TFL(+/+) mice during the resolution
phase, and IL-17a mRNA levels were markedly increased in TFL(-/-) cells. These
results suggest that TFL may play an important role in attenuating local
inflammation by suppressing the infiltration of Th17 cells in the CNS during the 
resolution phase of experimental autoimmune encephalitis. TFL is a novel gradual 
and persistent posttranscriptional regulator, and the TFL-driven attenuation of
excessive inflammation could contribute to recovery from T cell-mediated
autoimmune diseases.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a systemic inflammatory response due to the
recognition of major histocompatibility complex disparity between donor and
recipient after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). T-cell activation
is critical to the induction of GVHD, and data from our group and others have
shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) prevent GVHD when given at the time of
HSCT. Using multiphoton laser scanning microscopy, we examined the single cell
dynamics of donor T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) with or without Tregs
postallogeneic transplantation. We found that donor conventional T cells (Tcons) 
spent very little time screening host DCs. Tcons formed stable contacts with DCs 
very early after transplantation and only increased velocity in the lymph node at
20 hours after transplant. We also observed that Tregs reduced the interaction
time between Tcons and DCs, which was dependent on the generation of interleukin 
10 by Tregs. Imaging using inducible Tregs showed similar disruption of Tcon-DC
contact. Additionally, we found that donor Tregs induce host DC death and
down-regulate surface proteins required for donor T-cell activation. These data
indicate that Tregs use multiple mechanisms that affect host DC numbers and
function to mitigate acute GVHD.

PURPOSE: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has emerged as an important
biomarker in asthma. Increasing evidence points to atopy as a confounding factor 
in the interpretation of elevated FeNO. We conducted a longitudinal study to
understand the clinical significance of FeNO as an inflammatory biomarker.
METHODS: We identified 19 children aged 13-15 years at baseline with a
significant elevation in FeNO ≥ 80 parts per billion (ppb) and randomly selected 
a group of children of similar age with a moderate elevation (40-79 ppb) and
normal-to-low FeNO (<40 ppb). Between November 2010 and July 2011, three
additional study visits were conducted.
RESULTS: Ninety-three children participated in the study. There were 16, 24, and 
53 participants in the high, mid, and low FeNO groups. During 1.5 years of
follow-up, mean FeNO levels were 82.6 ppb (standard deviation [SD] = 65.9) for
atopic asthmatics, 50.6 ppb (SD = 42.6) for nonasthmatic atopics, 17.0 ppb
(SD = 10.8) for nonatopic asthmatics, and 17.8 ppb (SD = 13.9) for nonatopic
nonasthmatics (p < 0.001). FeNO levels remained stable: 63 % of the high FeNO
group had a FeNO ≥ 80 across all 4 measurements and 87 % of the normal-to-low
FeNO group had a FeNO of <40 across all 4 measurements. The high FeNO group also 
was found to have an elevation in IL-5 (p = 0.04), IL-6 (p = 0.003), IL-10
(p = 0.002), and total serum IgE (p < 0.001), after adjustment by age, sex,
height, body mass index, and atopy and asthma status.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevation of FeNO appears to indicate an atopic phenotype
regardless of an asthma diagnosis, clinical symptoms, or corticosteroid use. An
elevation of FeNO also is associated with a systemic elevation in inflammatory
cytokines.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its effector peptide angiotensin II (Ang 
II) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) degrades Ang II to angiotensin-(1-7)
[Ang-(1-7)] and has recently been described to have an antagonistic effect on ACE
signalling. However, the specific underlying role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of 
severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is unclear. In the present study, the local
imbalance of ACE and ACE2, as well as Ang II and Ang-(1-7) expression, was
compared in wild-type (WT) and ACE2 knock-out (KO) or ACE2 transgenic (TG) mice
subjected to cerulein-induced SAP. Serum amylase, tumour necrosis factor-α,
interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 levels and histological morphometry were used
to determine the severity of pancreatitis. In WT mice, pancreatic ACE and Ang II 
and serum Ang II expression increased (P < 0.05), while pancreatic ACE2 and
Ang-(1-7) and serum Ang-(1-7) levels were also significantly elevated (P < 0.05) 
from 2 to 72 h after the onset of SAP. However, the ratio of pancreatic ACE2 to
ACE expression was significantly reduced (from 1.46 ± 0.09 to 0.27 ± 0.05, P <
0.001) and paralleled the severity of pancreatitis. The Ace2 KO mice exhibited
increased levels of tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-6, multifocal coagulative
necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate, and lower levels of serum IL-10 and
pancreatic Ang-(1-7) (4.70 ± 2.13 versus 10.87 ± 2.51, P < 0.001) compared with
cerulein-treated WT mice at the same time point. Conversely, Ace2 TG mice with
normal ACE expression were more resistant to SAP challenge as evidenced by a
decreased inflammatory response, attenuated pathological changes and increased
survival rates. These data suggest that the ACE2-ACE imbalance plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of SAP and that pancreatic ACE2 is an important factor
in determining the severity of SAP.

BACKGROUND: The development of renal fibrosis is a consequence of arterial
hypertension. L-carnitine plays an essential role in the β-oxidation of fatty
acids, and we have previously demonstrated hypotensive, antioxidant, and
anti-inflammatory effects of L-carnitine in arterial hypertension. This work aims
to analyze the effect of L-carnitine on renal fibrosis and to explore the
participation of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-γ in this
effect.
METHODS: Four groups or rats were used: control, treated with L-carnitine,
treated with L-NAME, and treated with L-carnitine + L-NAME. Cultured rat kidney
cells were also used to examine the role of PPAR-γ in L-carnitine effect.
RESULTS: An increase in the expression of collagen, transforming growth factor
beta 1 (TGF-β1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), Nox2, and Nox4 was found
in the kidney of L-NAME-treated rats. Hypertensive rats presented with an
expansion of renal fibrotic areas, which was also accompanied by overexpression
of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. A reduction in the
expression of PPAR-γ and in that of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was found in the
kidney of these rats. Simultaneous treatment with L-carnitine attenuated the
renal fibrosis (which correlated with a reduction of plasma TGF-β1 levels) and
the pro-oxidative and proinflammatory status reported in L-NAME groups, with a
concomitant increase in the expression of PPAR-γ. Furthermore, the antifibrotic
effect of L-carnitine could be blocked by PPAR-γ inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the efficacy of L-carnitine against
hypertension-associated renal fibrosis from in vivo and in vitro studies and
suggests that the L-carnitine effect occurs in a PPAR-γ-dependent manner.

Inflammation is an important contributor to the development of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Anti-inflammatory medication may offer promising treatment for AD. 
Hydroxy-safflor yellow A (HSYA), a chemical component of the safflower yellow
pigments, has been reported to exert potent immunosuppressive effects. This study
examined the anti-inflammatory effects of HSYA in Aβ₁₋₄₂-treated BV-2 microglia
cells. The mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α, COX-2 and iNOS were detected
by real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expression
of COX-2, TNF-α, iNOS, Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2), p-JAK2, signal transducers and
activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and p-STAT3. BV2-conditioned medium was
used to treat SH-SY5Y cells and primary neuronal cells in indirect toxicity
experiments. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using MTT assay and
Annexin V/PI staining respectively. The results demonstrated that HSYA
significantly reduced the expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators and
inhibited Aβ₁₋₄₂-induced neuroinflammation. Moreover, HSYA protected primary
cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y cells against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. HSYA
also enhanced the phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway and inhibition of JAK2 by
AG 490 attenuated the anti-inflammatory effects of HSYA. Overall, our findings
suggested that HSYA inhibited Aβ₁₋₄₂-induced inflammation and conferred
neuroprotection partially through JAK2/STAT3 pathway, indicating that HSYA could 
be a potential drug for the treatment of AD.

Commensal gut microflora and dietary fiber protect against colonic inflammation
and colon cancer through unknown targets. Butyrate, a bacterial product from
fermentation of dietary fiber in the colon, has been implicated in this process. 
GPR109A (encoded by Niacr1) is a receptor for butyrate in the colon. GPR109A is
also a receptor for niacin, which is also produced by gut microbiota and
suppresses intestinal inflammation. Here we showed that Gpr109a signaling
promoted anti-inflammatory properties in colonic macrophages and dendritic cells 
and enabled them to induce differentiation of Treg cells and IL-10-producing T
cells. Moreover, Gpr109a was essential for butyrate-mediated induction of IL-18
in colonic epithelium. Consequently, Niacr1(-/-) mice were susceptible to
development of colonic inflammation and colon cancer. Niacin, a pharmacological
Gpr109a agonist, suppressed colitis and colon cancer in a Gpr109a-dependent
manner. Thus, Gpr10a has an essential role in mediating the beneficial effects of
gut microbiota and dietary fiber in colon.

Tear levels of certain cytokines/chemokines can potentially serve as biomarkers
for dry eye and other ocular surface diseases if they remain stable from
day-to-day in healthy eyes. The aim of this study was to determine the normal
intra- and inter-day variation of selected tear cytokines/chemokines. Tear
samples from 24 young, healthy adults were collected 11:00 AM-1:00 PM (mid-day)
and 5:00-7:00 PM (evening) on three non-consecutive days. Concentrations of 18
cytokines/chemokines (EGF, eotaxin, CX3CL1/fractalkine, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-10,
IL-1β, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-1RA, IL-5, IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-9, CXCL10/IP-10,
CCL5/RANTES, TNF-α, and VEGF) were measured by multiplex bead analysis. Ocular
surface disease was ruled out by clinical tests. A random-effects ANOVA model was
used to evaluate intra- and inter-day effects on cytokine/chemokine levels.
Repeatability of intra-subject inter-day measurements was assayed by coefficient 
of variation. Ten out of the 18 molecules had detectable tear levels in >50% of
the subjects. Of those, only IL-10 and IL-1β levels had significant inter-day
variations. EGF, CX3CL1/fractalkine, CXCL10/IP-10, and VEGF were consistently
higher in the evening compared to the mid-day measurements. EGF, CXCL10/IP-10,
VEGF and CXCL8/IL-8had good intra-subject reproducibility. In conclusion, tear
cytokines/chemokines can be measured reproducibly over time, with most not having
significant inter-day variability. Some varied significantly depending upon the
time of tear collection, and these variations should be taken into account when
comparisons are made. The good intra-subject reproducibility for EGF,
CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL8/IL-8, and VEGF indicates that these molecules could
potentially serve as biomarkers of ocular surface disease.

We investigated intra-specific variation in the response of salmon to infection
with the myxozoan Ceratomyxa shasta by comparing the progress of parasite
infection and measures of host immune response in susceptible and resistant
Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha at days 12, 25 and 90 post exposure.
There were no differences in invasion of the gills indicating that resistance
does not occur at the site of entry. In the intestine on day 12, infection
intensity and Ig(+) cell numbers were higher in susceptible than resistant fish, 
but histological examination at that timepoint showed more severe inflammation in
resistant fish. This suggests a role for the immune response in resistant fish
that eliminates some parasites prior to or soon after reaching the intestine.
Susceptible fish had a higher IFNγ, IL-6 and IL-10 response at day 12, but all
died of fatal enteronecrosis by day 25. The greatest fold change in IFNγ
expression was detected at day 25 in resistant Chinook. In addition, the number
of Ig(+) cells in resistant Chinook also increased by day 25. By day 90,
resistant Chinook had resolved the inflammation, cytokine expression had
decreased and Ig(+) cell numbers were similar to uninfected controls. Thus, it
appears that the susceptible strain was incapable of containing or eliminating
C. shasta but resistant fish: 1) reduced infection intensity during early
intestinal infection, 2) elicited an effective inflammatory response in the
intestine that eliminated C. shasta, 3) resolved the inflammation and recovered
from infection.

The tigerinins are a family of cationic, cyclic peptides of unknown biological
function produced in the skins of diverse frog species. Tigerinin-1R
(RVCSAIPLPICH.NH2) from Hoplobatrachus rugulosus (Dicroglossidae), tigerinin-1V
(RICYAMWIPYPC) from Lithobates vaillanti (Ranidae), and tigerinin-1M
(WCPPMIPLCSRF.NH2) from Xenopus muelleri (Pipidae) did not inhibit growth of
Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations up to 500 μg/ml and 
were not hemolytic. Incubation of peritoneal macrophages from both BALB/c and
C57BL/6 mice with tigerinin-1M, -1R and -1V (20 μg/ml) significantly (P < 0.05)
increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and potentiated the 
stimulation produced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Incubation with the tigerinins 
(20 μg/ml) significantly increased production of IL-6 in LPS-stimulated
macrophages from C57BL/6 mice but only tigerinin-1V potentiated IL-6 production
in LPS-stimulated macrophages from BALB/c mice. The tigerinins did not have
significant effects on the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and
IL-23 by macrophages from BALB/c mice. In a population of mononuclear cells
derived from mouse spleen, tigerinin-1M and -1V suppressed production of IFN-γ
with no effect on IL-17 production and the three tigerinins enhanced IL-10
production. The three tigerinins (≤ 5 μg/ml) also significantly increased
production of IL-10 in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. The data indicate that the tigerinins may function as
immunomodulatory host-defense peptides in frog skin.

PROBLEM: Epididymitis, one of the most common urological diseases, can lead to
the destruction of the epididymal duct and cause transient or permanent
sterility. The aim of this study was to investigate the functions and related
mechanisms of all trans retinoic acid (atRA) in alleviating the acute
inflammation of epididymitis.
METHOD OF STUDY: The mouse model of the epididymitis was induced by injecting
Escherichia coli into the cauda epididymis. atRA was administrated for five
consecutive days through intraperitoneal injection. The expression levels of
inflammatory cytokines were measured by real-time PCR and Western blot. In
addition, cultured primary mouse epididymal epithelial cells were treated with
different concentrations of atRA and RAR antagonists to identify whether the
effect of atRA was mediated through RAR.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that atRA ameliorates the inflammation in mouse 
epididymitis by decreasing the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and
increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory factors including TGF-β1 and
IL-10. Our results show that the upregulating effect of atRA on TGF-β1 was
mediated by RARα, and the enhancing effect of atRA on IL-10 expression was
mediated via RARβ.
CONCLUSION: These new results suggest that atRA is involved in regulating the
inflammatory response of epididymis.

Antibodies (Abs) to donor HLA (donor-specific antibodies [DSA]) have been
associated with transplant glomerulopathy (TG) following kidney transplantation
(KTx). Immune responses to tissue-restricted self-antigens (self-Ags) have been
proposed to play a role in chronic rejection. We determined whether KTx with TG
have immune responses to self-Ags, Collagen-IV (Col-IV) and fibronectin (FN). DSA
were determined by solid phase assay, Abs against Col-IV and FN by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay and CD4+ T cells secreting interferon gamma (IFN-γ), IL-17 or
IL-10 by ELISPOT. Development of Abs to self-Ags following KTx increased the risk
for TG with an odds ratio of 22 (p-value = 0.001). Abs to self-Ags were IgG and
IgM isotypes. Pretransplant Abs to self-Ags increased the risk of TG (22% vs.
10%, p < 0.05). Abs to self-Ags were identified frequently in KTx with DSA. TG
patients demonstrated increased Col-IV and FN specific CD4+ T cells secreting
IFN-γ and IL-17 with reduction in IL-10. We conclude that development of Abs to
self-Ags is a risk factor and having both DSA and Abs to self-Ags increases the
risk for TG. The increased frequency of self-Ag-specific IFN-γ and IL-17 cells
with reduction in IL-10 demonstrate tolerance breakdown to self-Ags which we
propose play a role in the pathogenesis of TG.

Glyphosate-based herbicides are the most frequently used herbicides in the world.
We evaluated the effect of Roundup 360 SL on the expression of interleukin-1β
(il-1β), interleukin-10 (il-10) and heme-oxygenase-1 (ho-1) in the gills,
intestines and spleen of young European sea bass (Dicentrachus labrax L.), aged 8
mo. A group of fish was exposed to 647 mg/L of Roundup for 96 h. This treatment
did not alter gene expression levels of il-1β and il-10 cytokine in the
intestines, but significantly lowered both levels in the gills (p = 0.02 and p = 
0.04 respectively). Expression levels of ho-1 were increased significantly in the
three organs of fish from the treated group (the gills p = 0.04, the intestines p
= 0.004 and the spleen p < 0.001). These changes may in turn negatively impact
the immune system of European sea bass exposed to Roundup.

The aim of this study was to assess the association of polymorphisms in the
promoter region of the IL-10 gene with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Fifteen
studies (3,693 cases and 4,574 controls) were included in a meta-analysis of
association between IL-10 -1082G/A, -819C/T and -592C/A polymorphisms, and IBD,
CD and UC using allele contrast and the recessive, dominant, and additive models.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was confirmed for each study. Heterogeneity and study 
quality were investigated using stratification analyses and sensitivity analyses.
Polymorphism -1082G/A showed significant association with CD, with odds ratios
(ORs) for the GG + GA genotype and GG versus AA genotype of 1.278 (1.004-1.627)
and 1.238 (1.027-1.492) in all subjects. Significant associations were found in
the Caucasian subgroup using the allele contrast, dominant, and additive models. 
C-allele carriers of the -819C/T polymorphism were at increased risk of IBD (OR
1.093, 95% CI 1.004-1.190). Association with the -819C/T polymorphism was also
found in Caucasians with CD (C vs. T: OR 1.104, 95% CI 1.010-1.206; CC + CT vs.
TT: OR 1.328, 95% CI 1.006-1.754; CC vs. TT: OR 1.339, 95% CI 1.008-1.778), and
with UC (CC vs. CT + TT: OR 1.188, 95% CI 1.019-1.385). No significant
association was found between the -592C/A polymorphism and IBD, CD or UC. In
conclusion, the meta-analysis demonstrated clear association between the IL-10
polymorphisms -1082G/A and -819C/T and the risk of IBD.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is highly activated in
multiple myeloma. Activated STAT3 promotes survival and proliferation of cancer
cells, suppresses Th1 immune response, and induces dysfunction of immune cells.
We investigated whether pretreating myeloma cells with a phosphor (p)-STAT3
inhibitor (JSI-124) and/or bortezomib before loading into dendritic cells (DCs)
can affect DC function. The combination treatment with JSI-124 and bortezomib
resulted in the highest expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 90 and the lowest 
expression of p-STAT3 in dying myeloma cells. DCs loaded with dying myeloma cells
treated by JSI-124 and bortezomib produced the least amount of p-STAT3 compared
to other treatments. The DCs were recovered from abnormal cytokine secretions of 
interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and IL-23 without any effect on production of
IL-12p70. DCs loaded with JSI-124 and bortezomib treated, dying myeloma cells
most potently generated myeloma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The data
suggest that pretreatment of myeloma cells with JSI-124 and bortezomib can
recover DC function through the up-regulation of HSP90 and the down-regulation of
p-STAT3 and inhibitory cytokines, and that these DCs can potently generate
myeloma-specific CTLs.

Impaired resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced pneumonia after cecal
ligation and puncture (CLP), a mouse model for human polymicrobial sepsis, is
associated with decreased IFN-γ, but increased IL-10, levels in the lung. We
investigated the so far unknown mechanisms underlying this reduced IFN-γ
synthesis in CLP mice. CD11b(+) NK cells, but not T or NKT cells in the lung were
impaired in IFN-γ synthesis upon challenge with Pseudomonas in vitro and in vivo 
after CLP. The inhibition of NK cells was independent of IL-10. IFN-γ synthesis
of NK cells was only partly restored by addition of recombinant IL-12. Accessory 
cells including dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages were required for
maximal IFN-γ secretion. But accessory cells of CLP mice suppressed the IFN-γ
secretion from naive lung leukocytes. In turn, naive accessory cells were unable 
to restore the IFN-γ production from lung leukocytes of CLP mice. Thus, a
disturbed interaction of accessory cells and NK cells is involved in the impaired
IFN-γ release in response to Pseudomonas in the lung of CLP mice. Considering the
importance of IFN-γ in the immune defense against bacteria the dysfunction of
accessory cells and NK cells might contribute to the enhanced susceptibility to
Pseudomonas after CLP.

Immune suppression is well documented during tumor progression, which includes
loss of effect of T cells and expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells. IL-7 plays 
a key role in the proliferation, survival and homeostasis of T cells and displays
a potent antitumor activity in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the
antitumor effect of IL-7 in Meth A model. IL-7 inhibited tumor growth and
prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice with corresponding increases in the 
frequency of CD4 and CD8 T cells, Th1 (CD4(+)IFN-γ(+)), Tc1 (CD8(+)IFN-γ(+)) and 
T cells cytolytic activity against Meth A cells. Neutralization of CD4 or CD8 T
cells reversed the antitumor benefit of IL-7. Furthermore, IL-7 decreased
regulatory T Foxp3 as well as cells suppressive activity with a reciprocal
increase in SMAD7. In addition, we observed an increase of the serum
concentrations of IL-6 and IFN-γ, and a significant decrease of TGF-β and IL-10
after IL-7 treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-7 augments T
cell-mediated antitumor immunity and improves the effect of antitumor in Meth A
model.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely studied for their applications in 
stem cell-based regeneration. During myocardial infarction (MI), infiltrated
macrophages have pivotal roles in inflammation, angiogenesis and cardiac
remodeling. We hypothesized that MSCs may modulate the immunologic environment to
accelerate regeneration. This study was designed to assess the functional
relationship between the macrophage phenotype and MSCs. MSCs isolated from bone
marrow and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) underwent differentiation
induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor. To determine the macrophage
phenotype, classical M1 markers and alternative M2 markers were analyzed with or 
without co-culturing with MSCs in a transwell system. For animal studies, MI was 
induced by the ligation of the rat coronary artery. MSCs were injected within the
infarct myocardium, and we analyzed the phenotype of the infiltrated macrophages 
by immunostaining. In the MSC-injected myocardium, the macrophages adjacent to
the MSCs showed strong expression of arginase-1 (Arg1), an M2 marker. In BMDMs
co-cultured with MSCs, the M1 markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β,
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
were significantly reduced. In contrast, the M2 markers such as IL-10, IL-4,
CD206 and Arg1 were markedly increased by co-culturing with MSCs. Specifically,
the ratio of iNOS to Arg1 in BMDMs was notably downregulated by co-culturing with
MSCs. These results suggest that the preferential shift of the macrophage
phenotype from M1 to M2 may be related to the immune-modulating characteristics
of MSCs that contribute to cardiac repair.

BACKGROUND: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a negative regulator of immune responses
and was previously shown to be expressed by human nasal endothelial cells, while 
the adhesion molecule MECA-79 plays a role in trans-endothelial migration of
immune competent cells. In this study we investigate the relationship between
endothelial IL-10 and MECA-79 expression to address the question whether immune
competent cells could be affected at the mucosal entry site.
METHODS: Nasal turbinate biopsies were taken from house dust mite allergic
patients, before and after nasal allergen provocation. Subsequent slides of
biopsies were stained for IL10, MECA-79, CD34, and IL10-Receptor. Capillaries,
arteries/veins, and sinusoids were evaluated separately.
RESULTS: 90% of sinusoids are IL-10 positive and all sinusoids are negative for
MECA-79, while 4.8% of capillaries are positive for IL-10, and 2.2% are positive 
for MECA-79. Although about 47% of arteries/veins are positive for IL-10 and
57.1% are positive for MECA-79, only about 20% are positive for both markers.
Furthermore, we showed that the myo-fibroblasts surrounding all sinusoids stain
positive for IL10R.
CONCLUSIONS: IL10 expression on vascular structures is not related to MECA
expression for sinusoids and capillaries and only partly related on
arteries/veins, however sinusoidal endothelial IL10 expression is always seen in 
combination with IL-10R expression of sinusoidal myo-fibroblasts.

Characterization of T cell phenotype and function in a double transgenic
(collagen-specific TCR/HLA-DR1) humanized model of arthritis.

Tang B, Kim S, Hammond S, Cullins DL, Brand DD, Rosloniec EF, Stuart JM,
Postlethwaite AE, Kang AH, Myers LK.

INTRODUCTION: T cells orchestrate joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis
(RA), yet they are difficult to study due to the small numbers of
antigen-specific cells. The goal of this study was to characterize a new
humanized model of autoimmune arthritis and to describe the phenotypic and
functional changes that occur in autoimmune T cells following the induction of
pathological events.
METHODS: We developed a double transgenic mouse containing both the HLA-DR1
transgene and an HLA-DR1-restricted collagen-specific TCR in order to obtain
large numbers of antigen-specific T cells that can be used for immunologic
studies.
RESULTS: In vitro, CII-specific T cells from this mouse proliferated vigorously
in response to the CII immunodominant peptide A2 and the cells altered their
phenotype to become predominately CD62Llow and CD44high "activated" T cells. The 
response was accompanied by the production of Th1, Th2, and Th17-type cytokines. 
Following immunization with bovine CII/CFA, these mice develop an accelerated
arthritis compared to single transgenic HLA-DR1 mice. On the other hand, when the
mice were treated orally with the analog peptide A12, (a suppressive analog of
collagen we have previously described), arthritis was significantly suppressed,
despite the fact that >90% of the CD4+ T cells express the TCR Tg. In GALT
tissues taken from the A12-treated mice, IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-17 production to the
autoimmune collagen determinant dropped while high levels of IL-10 and IL-4 were 
produced.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a humanized model of autoimmune arthritis that
will be useful for the study of T cell directed therapies as well as T cell
mediated mechanisms of autoimmune diseases.

BACKGROUND: Some health behaviours are liable to affect the incidence of
allergies and/or common infections in young people; however, the extent and ways 
in which these might occur are mostly unknown. This study examines the
association of health behaviours related to physical activity, sedentariness,
diet and sleep with allergy and infection symptoms in adolescents, and also with 
biological markers that might mediate disease incidence.
METHODS: The study comprised a total of 2054 adolescents (50.7% girls) from the
Madrid region of Spain. The incidence of infection and allergy symptoms three
months prior to the study was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire.
Physical and sedentary activities, height and weight, food habits and sleep
duration were also self-reported and their influence on infection and allergy
incidence was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Blood biomarkers (IgE,
eosinophil percentage, leptin, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10) were
evaluated in a subsample of 198 subjects.
RESULTS: Adequate sleep duration (OR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.64 to 0.97) and unhealthy
weight status (overweight/obesity) (OR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.04-1.74) were
independently associated with decreased and increased allergy incidence,
respectively. No significant association was observed with infection incidence.
IgE and leptin differed between adolescents with and without allergy symptoms. In
regression models IgE was significantly associated with inadequate sleep duration
and leptin with weight status.
CONCLUSION: Excess weight and inadequate sleep duration are independently
associated with the incidence of allergy symptoms in adolescents. Adequate sleep 
duration and weight during adolescence might be relevant for a decreased risk of 
suffering allergy symptoms.

The cytokine IL-10 has an important role in limiting inflammation in many
settings, including toxoplasmosis. In the present studies, an IL-10 reporter
mouse was used to identify the sources of this cytokine following challenge with 
Toxoplasma gondii. During infection, multiple cell types expressed the IL-10
reporter but NK cells were a major early source of this cytokine. These IL-10
reporter(+) NK cells expressed high levels of the IL-12 target genes T-bet,
KLRG1, and IFN-γ, and IL-12 depletion abrogated reporter expression. However,
IL-12 signaling alone was not sufficient to promote NK cell IL-10, and activation
of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) was also required for maximal IL-10
production. NK cells basally expressed the AHR, relevant chaperone proteins, and 
the AHR nuclear translocator, which heterodimerizes with the AHR to form a
competent transcription factor. In vitro studies revealed that IL-12 stimulation 
increased NK cell AHR levels, and the AHR and AHR nuclear translocator were
required for optimal production of IL-10. Additionally, NK cells isolated from T.
gondii-infected Ahr(-/-) mice had impaired expression of IL-10, which was
associated with increased resistance to this infection. Taken together, these
data identify the AHR as a critical cofactor involved in NK cell production of
IL-10.

Mycobacterium massiliense induces inflammatory responses in macrophages through
Toll-like receptor 2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.

Mycobacterium massiliense (Mmass) is an emerging, rapidly growing mycobacterium
(RGM) that belongs to the M. abscessus (Mabc) group, albeit clearly
differentiated from Mabc. Compared with M. tuberculosis, a well-characterized
human pathogen, the host innate immune response against Mmass infection is
largely unknown. In this study, we show that Mmass robustly activates mRNA and
protein expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 in
murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and
myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), but neither TLR4 nor
Dectin-1, are involved in Mmass-induced TNF-α or IL-6 production in BMDMs. Mmass 
infection also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs; c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) pathway. Mmass-induced TNF-α and
IL-6 production was dependent on JNK activation, while they were unaffected by
either the ERK1/2 or p38 pathway in BMDMs. Additionally, intracellular reactive
oxygen species (ROS), NADPH oxidase-2, and nuclear factor-κB are required for
Mmass-induced proinflammatory cytokine generation in macrophages. Furthermore,
the S morphotype of Mmass showed lower overall induction of pro-inflammatory
(TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines than the R
morphotype, suggesting fewer immunogenic characteristics for this clinical
strain. Together, these results suggest that Mmass-induced activation of host
proinflammatory cytokines is mediated through TLR2-dependent JNK and ROS
signaling pathways.

PURPOSE: Much research is now being conducted in order to understand the role of 
cytokines in the development of the inflammatory response following trauma. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate whether serum levels of certain cytokines, 
measured immediately after initial injury, can be used as potential biomarkers
for predicting the development and the degree of severity of the systemic
inflammatory response (SIRS) in patients with moderate and severe trauma.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study with 71 individuals of whom 13 (18.3 %)
were healthy controls and 58 (81.7 %) were traumatized orthopaedic patients who
were categorized into two groups: 31 (43.6 %) with moderate injuries and 27 (38.1
%) patients with severe orthopaedic trauma. Thirty cc of heparinized blood were
drawn from each individual within a few hours after the injury. Serum levels of
pro-inflammatory, regulatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured in
each individual participant.
RESULTS: High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β,-6,-8,-12, tumour
necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma were found in all injured patients
compared to healthy controls. Only IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly higher in the
injured patients. Levels of the regulatory cytokines, transformed growth factor
beta (TGF-β) and IL-10 were higher in the injured patients, but significant only 
for TGF-β. Levels of IL-4 were significantly lower in the injured groups as
compared to the controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Secretion of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
decreased level of anti-inflammatory cytokines during the acute phase of trauma
may lead to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in 
unstable polytraumatized patients. SIRS may result in life threatening conditions
as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure (MOF).
High levels of IL-6, IL-8, TGFβ and low levels of IL-4 were found to be reliable 
markers for the existence of immune reactivity in trauma patients. More research 
is needed to study pattern of cytokine levels along the acute period of injury,
after surgical interventions and during recovery.

The release of cytokines by T cells strongly defines their functional activity in
vivo. The ability to produce multiple cytokines has been associated with
beneficial immune responses in cancer and infectious diseases, while their
progressive loss is associated with T-cell exhaustion, senescence and anergy.
Consequently, strategies that enhance the multifunctional status of T cells are a
key for immunotherapy. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting 
cells that regulate T-cell functions by providing positive and negative
co-stimulatory signals. A key negative regulator of T-cell activity is provided
by binding of programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on activated T cells, to its
ligand PD-L1, expressed on DCs. We investigated the impact of interfering with
PD-L1/PD-1 co-stimulation on the multifunctionality of T cells, by expression of 
the soluble extracellular part of PD-1 (sPD-1) or PD-L1 (sPD-L1) in human
monocyte-derived DCs during antigen presentation. Expression, secretion and
binding of these soluble molecules after mRNA electroporation were demonstrated. 
Modification of DCs with sPD-1 or sPD-L1 mRNA resulted in increased levels of the
co-stimulatory molecule CD80 and a distinct cytokine profile, characterized by
the secretion of IL-10 and TNF-α, respectively. Co-expression in DCs of sPD-1 and
sPD-L1 with influenza virus nuclear protein 1 (Flu NP1) stimulated Flu NP1 memory
T cells, with a significantly higher number of multifunctional T cells and
increased cytokine secretion, while it did not induce regulatory T cells. These
data provide a rationale for the inclusion of interfering sPD-1 or sPD-L1 in
DC-based immunotherapeutic strategies.

systemic attenuation in immunocompromised hosts.

Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infections are emerging as leading problem
worldwide and the variations in host immune status append to the concern of NTS. 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the causative agents of NTS
infections and has been extensively studied. The inactivation of Salmonella
pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) encoded type-III secretion system 2 (TTSS2) has
been reported rendering the strain incapable for systemic dissemination to host
sites and has also been proposed as live-attenuated vaccine. However, infections 
from TTSS2-deficient Salmonella have also been reported. In this study, mutant
strain MT15 was developed by inactivation of the hemolysin expression modulating 
protein (hha) in TTSS2-deficient S. Typhimurium background. The MT15 strain
showed significant level of attenuation in immune-deprived murine colitis model
when tested in iNos(-/-), IL10(-/-), and CD40L(-/-) mice groups in C57BL/6
background. Further, the mutation in hha does not implicate any defect in
bacterial colonization to the host gut. The long-term infection of developed
mutant strain conferred protective immune responses to suitably immunized
streptomycin pre-treated C57BL/6 mice. The immunization enhanced the CD4(+) and
CD8(+) cell types involved in bacterial clearance. The serum IgG and luminal
secretory IgA (sIgA) was also found to be elevated after the due course of
infection. Additionally, the immunized C57BL/6 mice were protected from the
subsequent lethal infection of Salmonella Typhimurium. Collectively, these
findings implicate the involvement of hemolysin expression modulating protein
(Hha) in establishment of bacterial infection. In light of the observed
attenuation of the developed mutant strain, this study proposes the possible
significance of SPI2-deficient hha mutant as an alternative live-attenuated
vaccine strain for use against lethal Salmonella infections.

Paulo, Brazil. sartori@ibb.unesp.br.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial superantigens are potent T cell activators that can
activate T cells with specificity for antigens of the central nervous system
(CNS). In this study, we compared the effect of two S. aureus strains on
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) development. C57BL/6 female mice 
were infected with S. aureus ATCC 51650, which produces toxic shock syndrome
toxin 1 (TSST-1+) or S. aureus ATCC 43300, which does not produce toxins (TOX-). 
Three days later, the animals were subjected to EAE induction by immunization
with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The weight variation, disease
incidence and clinical score were recorded daily. Cytokines and Foxp3+ regulatory
T cells in the brain were evaluated during the acute disease phase. Cytokines and
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in the spleen and histopathological analysis of the CNS
were assessed during the chronic stage.
RESULTS: Previous infection with both strains similarly decreased the clinical
score; however, only the TSST-1+ strain clearly diminished inflammation in the
CNS. The infections also modulated cytokine production in the spleen and CNS.
Reduced production of IL-5 and IL-10 was detected in MOG-stimulated spleen
cultures in the TOX- and TSST-1+ infected groups, respectively. In S. aureus
stimulated cultures, there was an increased production of IFN-γ and IL-10 in both
infected groups and an increased level of IL-5 in the TSST-1+ group. CNS
infiltrating cell cultures from previously infected mice produced less IL-17 in
response to MOG and more IFN-γ in response to S. aureus stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that both strains attenuated clinical EAE
manifestations, but only TSST-1 clearly decreased CNS inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Immune protection against pathogenic organisms has been shown to
incur costs. Previous studies investigating the cost of immunity have mostly
focused on the metabolic requirements of immune maintenance and activation. In
addition to these metabolic costs, the immune system can induce damage to the
host if the immune response is mis-targeted or over-expressed. Given its
non-specific nature, an over-expressed inflammatory response is often associated 
with substantial damage for the host. Here, we investigated the cost of an
over-expressed inflammatory response in the reproductive function of male mice.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We experimentally blocked the receptors of an
anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in male mice exposed to a mild inflammatory
challenge, with each treatment having an appropriate control group. The
experiment was conducted on two age classes, young (3 month old) and old (15
month old) mice, to assess any age-related difference in the cost of a disrupted 
immune regulation. We found that the concomitant exposure to an inflammatory
insult and the blockade of IL-10 induced a reduction in testis mass, compared to 
the three other groups. The frequency of abnormal sperm morphology was also
higher in the group of mice exposed to the inflammatory challenge but did not
depend on the blockade of the IL-10.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that immune regulation confers
protection against the risk of inflammation-induced infertility during infection.
They also suggest that disruption of the effectors involved in the regulation of 
the inflammatory response can have serious fitness consequences even under mild
inflammatory insult and benign environmental conditions.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections represent one of the major threats for injured 
or transplanted lungs and for their healing. Considering that the mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) are a major tool for the regenerative medicine, including
therapy of lung damaging diseases, the aim of this paper was to investigate the
effects of P. aeruginosa quorum sensing signaling molecules (QSSMs) on human MSCs
death signaling pathways and cytokine profile. Our data revealed that
N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone
(C4-HSL), 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS), and its precursor,
2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ), significantly impact on several core signaling
mechanisms of MSCs in a specific and time-dependent manner. Even if all tested
autoinducers interfered with the MSCs apoptotic genes expression, only OdDHL and 
HHQ significantly promoted MSCs apoptosis, by 14- and 23-fold respectively, this 
aspect being confirmed by the flow cytometry assay. The tested QSSMs induced a
heterogeneous cytokine profile of the treated MSCs. The level of IL-1β was
increased by OdDHL, IL-8 production was stimulated by all tested autoinducers,
IL-6 was modulated mostly by PQS and IL-10 by HHQ. The significant influence of
the purified bacterial autoinducers on the MSCs signaling pathways may suggest
that the accumulation of these mediators could interfere with the normal function
of these cells in the human body, and eventually, impair or abolish the success
of the stem cells therapy during P. aeruginosa infections.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication among hemodialysis (HD) patients.
Although intravenous iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents revolutionized
anemia treatment, about 10% of HD patients show suboptimal response to these
agents. Systemic inflammation and increased serum hepcidin level may contribute
to this hyporesponsiveness. Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of
omega-3 fatty acids, this study aimed to evaluate potential role of these fatty
acids in improving anemia and inflammation of chronic HD patients.
METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 54 adult patients with HD 
duration of at least 3 months were randomized to ingest 1800 mg of either omega-3
fatty acids or matching placebo per day for 4 months. Anemia parameters including
blood hemoglobin, serum iron, transferrin saturation (TSAT), erythropoietin
resistance index, and required dose of intravenous iron and erythropoietin, and
serum concentrations of inflammatory/anti-inflammatory markers including
interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-10, C-reactive protein
(CRP), hepcidin, ferritin, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and ratios of IL-10
to IL-6 and IL-10 to TNF-α were measured at baseline and after 4 months of the
intervention.
RESULTS: 45 subjects (25 in the omega-3 and 20 in the placebo group) completed
the study. No significant changes were observed in blood hemoglobin, serum iron, 
TSAT, and required dose of intravenous iron in either within or between group
comparisons. Additionally, erythropoietin resistance index as well as required
dose of intravenous erythropoietin showed no significant change in the omega-3
group compared to the placebo group. Although a relative alleviation in
inflammatory state appeared in the omega-3 group, the mean differences of
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers between the two groups did not reach
statistically significant level except for IL-10-to-IL-6 ratio and serum ferritin
level which showed significant changes in favor of omega-3 treatment (P <0.001
and P = 0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Omega-3 fatty acids relatively improved systemic inflammation of
chronic HD patients without any prominent benefits on anemia. However, future
well-designed studies on larger number of patients may determine utility of
omega-3 fatty acids in HD patients with respect to inflammation and anemia.

Toxoplasma gondii upregulates interleukin-12 to prevent Plasmodium
berghei-induced experimental cerebral malaria.

Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.

A chronic infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii has previously been shown
to protect mice against subsequent viral, bacterial, or protozoal infections.
Here we have shown that a chronic T. gondii infection can prevent Plasmodium
berghei ANKA-induced experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in C57BL/6 mice.
Treatment with soluble T. gondii antigens (STAg) reduced parasite sequestration
and T cell infiltration in the brains of P. berghei-infected mice. Administration
of STAg also preserved blood-brain barrier function, reduced ECM symptoms, and
significantly decreased mortality. STAg treatment 24 h post-P. berghei infection 
led to a rapid increase in serum levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12) and gamma
interferon (IFN-γ). By 5 days after P. berghei infection, STAg-treated mice had
reduced IFN-γ levels compared to those of mock-treated mice, suggesting that
reductions in IFN-γ at the time of ECM onset protected against lethality. Using
IL-10- and IL-12βR-deficient mice, we found that STAg-induced protection from ECM
is IL-10 independent but IL-12 dependent. Treatment of P. berghei-infected mice
with recombinant IL-12 significantly decreased parasitemia and mortality. These
data suggest that IL-12, either induced by STAg or injected as a recombinant
protein, mediates protection from ECM-associated pathology potentially through
early induction of IFN-γ and reduction in parasitemia. These results highlight
the importance of early IL-12 induction in protection against ECM.

IL-17A-expressing CD4(+) T cells (Th17 cells) are generally regarded as key
effectors of autoimmune inflammation. However, not all Th17 cells are
pro-inflammatory. Pathogenic Th17 cells that induce autoimmunity in mice are
distinguished from nonpathogenic Th17 cells by a unique transcriptional
signature, including high Il23r expression, and these cells require Il23r for
their inflammatory function. In contrast, defining features of human
pro-inflammatory Th17 cells are unknown. We show that pro-inflammatory human Th17
cells are restricted to a subset of CCR6(+)CXCR3(hi)CCR4(lo)CCR10(-)CD161(+)
cells that transiently express c-Kit and stably express P-glycoprotein
(P-gp)/multi-drug resistance type 1 (MDR1). In contrast to MDR1(-) Th1 or Th17
cells, MDR1(+) Th17 cells produce both Th17 (IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22) and Th1
(IFN-γ) cytokines upon TCR stimulation and do not express IL-10 or other
anti-inflammatory molecules. These cells also display a transcriptional signature
akin to pathogenic mouse Th17 cells and show heightened functional responses to
IL-23 stimulation. In vivo, MDR1(+) Th17 cells are enriched and activated in the 
gut of Crohn's disease patients. Furthermore, MDR1(+) Th17 cells are refractory
to several glucocorticoids used to treat clinical autoimmune disease. Thus,
MDR1(+) Th17 cells may be important mediators of chronic inflammation,
particularly in clinical settings of steroid resistant inflammatory disease.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the immunosuppressive effect and mechanism of action of
intraperitoneal (ip) and intra-articular (ia) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
injection in proteoglycan induced arthritis (PGIA).
METHODS: MSC were administered ip or ia after establishment of arthritis. We used
serial bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to trace luciferase-transfected MSC. Mice
were sacrificed at different time points to examine immunomodulatory changes in
blood and secondary lymphoid organs.
RESULTS: Both ip and local ia MSC injection resulted in a beneficial clinical and
histological effect on established PGIA. BLI showed that MSC ip and ia in
arthritic mice are largely retained for several weeks in the peritoneal cavity or
injected joint respectively, without signs of migration. Following MSC treatment 
pathogenic PG-specific IgG2a antibodies in serum decreased. The Th2 cytokine IL-4
was only upregulated in PG-stimulated lymphocytes from spleens in ip treated mice
and in lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes in ia treated mice. An increase in
production of IL-10 was seen with equal distribution. Although IFN-γ was also
elevated, the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio in MSC treated mice was opposite to the ratio in
(untreated) active PGIA.
CONCLUSIONS: MSC treatment, both ip and ia, suppresses PGIA, a non-collagen
induced arthritis model. MSC are largely retained for weeks in the injection
region. MSC treatment induced at the region of injection a deviation of
PG-specific immune responses, suggesting a more regulatory phenotype with
production of IL-4 and IL-10, but also of IFN-γ, and a systemic decrease of
pathogenic PG-specific IgG2a antibodies. These findings underpin the potential of
MSC treatment in resistant arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: Accelerated atherosclerosis is a major source of morbidity in systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the cause of SLE-accelerated atherosclerosis 
remains unclear.
METHODS: CD4(+) T cells from C57/Bl/6 (B6) or SLE-susceptible B6.Sle1.2.3
(B6.SLE) mice were transferred into LDLr(-/-), Rag(-/-) mice. T cells were
examined for cytokine production and expression of interleukin-10 receptor
(IL-10R) and functional markers. T cells were isolated based on FoxP3(GFP)
expression and transferred to LDLr(-/-), Rag(-/-) mice to establish a role for
B6.SLE effector T cells (Teff) in atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: Mice receiving whole B6.SLE CD4(+) T cells displayed no other SLE
phenotype; however, atherosclerosis was increased nearly 40%. We noted
dysregulated IL-17 production and reduced frequency of IL-10R expression by
B6.SLE regulatory T cells (Treg). Functional assays indicated resistance of
B6.SLE Teff to suppression by both B6.SLE and B6 Treg. Transfer experiments with 
CD4(+)FoxP3(-) Teff and CD4(+)FoxP3(+) Treg from B6.SLE and B6 mice,
respectively, resulted in increased atherosclerosis compared with B6 Teff and
Treg recipients. Treg isolated from mice receiving B6.SLE Teff with B6 Treg had
increased production of IL-17 and fewer expressed IL-10R compared with B6 Teff
and Treg transfer.
CONCLUSIONS: Transfer of B6.SLE Teff to LDLr(-/-), Rag(-/-) mice results in
accelerated atherosclerosis independent of the source of Treg. In addition, the
presence of B6.SLE Teff resulted in more IL-17-producing Treg and fewer
expressing IL-10R, suggesting that B6.SLE Teff may mediate phenotypic changes in 
Treg. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide direct evidence of the
role of B6.SLE Teff in accelerating atherosclerosis through resistance to Treg
suppression.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have potential to differentiate into multiple cell 
lineages. Recently, it was shown that MSCs also have anti-inflammatory and
immunomodulatory functions. In this report, we investigated the regulatory
function of MSCs in the development of inflammatory bone destruction in rats with
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA rats). MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow
tissues, expanded in the presence of basic FGF, and intraperitoneally injected
into AA rats. MSC administration significantly suppressed inflammatory
parameters: swelling score, swelling width, and thickness of hind paw.
Radiographic evaluation indicated that MSC significantly suppressed bone
destruction. Histological analysis showed that administration of MSCs markedly
suppressed osteoclastogenesis in AA rats. To further delineate their effects on
osteoclastogenesis, MSCs were added to in vitro bone marrow cultures undergoing
osteoclastogenesis. MSCs significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis in this
system. Chemokine receptor expression in MSCs was assessed by RT-PCR, and a
chemotactic assay was performed using a transwell culture system. MSCs showed
significant chemotaxis to MIP-1α (CCL3) and SDF-1α (CXCL12), chemokines
preferentially expressed in the area of inflammatory bone destruction.
Furthermore, MSCs expressed IL-10 and osteoprotegerin, cytokines that suppress
osteoclastogenesis. These data suggest that recruitment of MSC to the area of
bone destruction in AA rats could suppress inflammatory bone destruction and
raise the possibility that MSCs may have potential for the treatment of
inflammatory bone destruction in arthritis.

The exacerbated disease due to immune- and coagulative-mediated pulmonary injury 
during acute respiratory viruses infection results in severe morbidity and
mortality. Identifying novel approaches to modulate virus-induced
inflammation-coagulation interactions could be important alternatives for
treating acute respiratory viruses infections. In this study we investigated the 
effect of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 on lung
TLR3-mediated inflammation, and its ability to modulate inflammation-coagulation 
interaction during respiratory viral infection. Our findings reveal for the first
time that a probiotic bacterium is able to influence lung immune-coagulative
reaction triggered by TLR3 activation, by modulating the production of
proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as expression of tissue
factor and thrombomodulin in the lung. We also demonstrated that the preventive
treatment with the probiotic bacteria beneficially modulates the fine tune
balance between clearing respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus and
influenza virus) and controlling immune-coagulative responses in the lung,
allowing normal lung function to be maintained in the face of a viral attack. Our
data also pinpoint a crucial role for IL-10 in the immune protection induced by
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 during respiratory viral infections. These observations
might be helpful to propose new preventive or therapeutic approaches to better
control virus-inflammatory lung damage using probiotic functional foods.

BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation.
Integrative genomic analysis of airway inflammation on genetic and protein level 
may help to unravel mechanisms of childhood asthma. We aimed to employ an
integrative genomic approach investigating inflammation markers on DNA, mRNA, and
protein level at preschool age in relationship to asthma development.
METHODS: In a prospective study, 252 preschool children (202 recurrent wheezers, 
50 controls) from the Asthma DEtection and Monitoring (ADEM) study were followed 
until the age of six. Genetic variants, mRNA expression in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and protein levels in exhaled breath condensate for
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), interleukin (IL)4, IL8, IL10, IL13,
and tumor necrosis factor α were analyzed at preschool age. At six years of age, 
a classification (healthy, transient wheeze, or asthma) was based on symptoms,
lung function, and medication use.
RESULTS: The ICAM1 rs5498 A allele was positively associated with asthma
development (p = 0.02) and ICAM1 gene expression (p = 0.01). ICAM1 gene
expression was positively associated with exhaled levels of soluble ICAM1
(p = 0.04) which in turn was positively associated with asthma development
(p = 0.01). Furthermore, rs1800872 and rs1800896 in IL10 were associated with
altered IL10 mRNA expression (p < 0.01). Exhaled levels of IL4, IL10, and IL13
were positively associated with asthma development (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In this unique prospective study, we demonstrated that ICAM1 is
associated with asthma development on DNA, mRNA, and protein level. Thus, ICAM1
is likely to be involved in the development of childhood asthma.

BACKGROUND: There is promising but conflicting evidence to recommend the addition
of probiotics to foods for prevention and treatment of allergy. Based on previous
studies with fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461, we aimed 
to compare the effect of a powder form of the latter probiotic with the effect of
a blend of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC SD5221 and Bifidobacterium lactis ATCC 
SD5219 in patients with allergic rhinitis.
METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, involving 31 adults with
allergic rhinitis to grass pollen, was performed outside the grass pollen season 
(registration number: NCT01233154). Subjects received each product for 4-weeks in
two phases separated by a wash-out period of 6 to 8 weeks. A nasal provocation
test was performed before and after each 4-week product intake period, and
outcome parameters (objective and subjective clinical symptoms; immune
parameters) were measured during and/or 24 hours after the test.
RESULTS: Out of the 31 subject enrolled, 28 completed the study. While no effect 
was observed on nasal congestion (primary outcome), treatment with NCC2461
significantly decreased nasal pruritus (determined by VAS), and leukocytes in
nasal fluid samples, enhanced IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 production by peripheral
blood mononuclear cells in an allergen specific manner and tended to decrease
IL-5 secretion in nasal fluid, in contrast to treatment with the blend of L.
acidophilus and B. lactis.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite short-term consumption, NCC2461 was able to reduce
subjective nasal pruritus while not affecting nasal congestion in adults
suffering from grass pollen allergic rhinitis. The associated decrease in nasal
fluid leukocytes and IL-5 secretion, and the enhanced IL-10 secretion in an
allergen specific manner may partly explain the decrease in nasal pruritus.
However, somewhat unexpected systemic immune changes were also noted. These data 
support the study of NCC2461 consumption in a seasonal clinical trial to further 
demonstrate its potentially beneficial effect.

BACKGROUND: Sjogren's syndrome is characterized by T-cell infiltration of
exocrine glands leading to parenchymal destruction and impaired glandular
function. This process is orchestrated by cytokines, whose secretion can be
regulated by genetic polymorphisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of 
interleukin-6 -174G/C, interleukin-10 -1082G/A, tumor necrosis factor-α -308G/A, 
interferon-γ +874A/T gene polymorphisms in (RA) and secondary Sjögren's syndrome 
(sSS). A study sample that comprised of 138 Brazilian patients was divided into
three groups: RA (n = 66), sSS (n = 20), and healthy controls - C (n = 52).
Patients were subjected to Schirmer's test, unstimulated salivary flow rate,
biopsy of minor salivary glands, and serological tests for diagnosing SS. Genomic
DNA was obtained from saliva samples and submitted to genotyping. The association
between genotypes/alelle frequency and SS susceptibility was tested, as well as
their association with clinical features of SS.
RESULTS: Tumor necrosis factorα (TNFα)-308GA polymorphisms differed significantly
between AR, SS, and C patients (P = 0.008). IL-6 overall G carriers and TNFα A
carriers had a higher risk of presenting SS (P = 0.021). IL-6 polymorphism
distribution was also distinctive regarding lymphocytic infiltration at the minor
salivary glands (P = 0.026) and Schirmer's test (P = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IL-6 -174GC and TNFα-308GA gene
polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to SS. Additionally, IL-6
polymorphism could influence lymphocytic infiltration of salivary glands and
diminish lachrymal gland function.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by
whole blood samples stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from normotensive and
preeclamptic women.
METHODS: The synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukyn-1β, interleukin-6 
and interleukin-10 were assayed by immunosorbent assays in 56 and 50 preeclamptic
and normotensive women, respectively.
RESULTS: Preeclamptic women showed a higher synthesis (p < 0.05) of
interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 versus normotensive group. Interleukin-10
synthesis from samples of normotensive women showed a higher production versus
preeclamptic group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Preeclamptic women showed an imbalance in the production of pro and
anti-inflammatory cytokines in comparison with normotensive women.

Macro- and microvascular function in habitually exercising systemic lupus
erythematosus patients.

OBJECTIVES: Vascular dysfunction is commonly observed in systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) patients and may explain the accelerated cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk. It is unknown whether physical activity influences vascular
function in SLE patients. We aimed to determine whether habitually exercising SLE
patients also demonstrate a reduction in vascular function.
METHOD: This study involved 41 young and middle-aged adults, including 15 healthy
controls, 12 sedentary SLE patients, and 14 physically active SLE patients.
RESULTS: Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a measure of macrovascular function, was
lower (3.6 ± 1.3 vs. 8.1 ± 1.2%; p < 0.05) and inflammatory markers [C-reactive
protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-12, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α] were
higher in sedentary SLE patients than in age-matched healthy controls (p < 0.05).
Importantly, FMD and inflammatory markers were not different between physically
active SLE patients and healthy controls. There were no group differences in skin
reactive hyperaemia (RH) or minimal vascular resistance, both measures of
microvascular function. Physically active SLE patients had lower intercellular
adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 concentrations and SLE disease activity scores than
their sedentary peers. FMD was inversely associated with IL-6 and IL-10 (both p <
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant SLE-associated macrovascular dysfunction was absent in
physically active SLE patients. Additionally, vascular function was associated
with inflammatory markers, suggesting that the favourable influence of physical
activity may be mediated by its effect on inflammation.

Hyperbaric oxygen treatment produces an antinociceptive response phase and
inhibits astrocyte activation and inflammatory response in a rat model of
neuropathic pain.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment has been proven to be a promising candidate for
protection of the nervous system after acute injury in animal models of
neuropathic pain. The purposes of this study were to examine the antinociceptive 
response phase induced by HBO treatment in a model of neuropathic pain and to
determine the dependence of the treatment's mechanism of alleviating neuropathic 
pain on the inhibition of spinal astrocyte activation. Neuropathic pain was
induced in rats by chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. Mechanical
threshold and thermal latency were tested preoperatively and for 1 week
postoperatively, four times daily at fixed time points. Methane dicarboxylic
aldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) parameters were used as indices of 
oxidative stress response and tested before and after the treatment. The
inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 were assayed in the sciatic 
nerve were with enzyme-linked immunoassay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein
activation in the spinal cord was evaluated immunohistochemically. The rats
exhibited temporary allodynia immediately after HBO treatment completion. This
transient allodynia was closely associated with changes in MDA and SOD levels. A 
single HBO treatment caused a short-acting antinociceptive response phase.
Repetitive HBO treatment led to a long-acting antinociceptive response phase and 
inhibited astrocyte activation. These results indicated that HBO treatment played
a dual role in the aggravation and alleviation of neuropathic pain, though the
aggravated pain effect (transient allodynia) was far less pronounced than the
antinociceptive phase. Astrocyte inhibition and anti-inflammation may contribute 
to the antinociceptive effect of HBO treatment after nerve injury.

INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) induce many cancer conditions and cause 
cervical cancer, second in frequency of malignant disease in women.The aim was to
develop biomarker panel for HPV-induced cervical precancerous diseases in
patients infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 71 women with cervical precancerous
diseases (mean age 26 ± 5 years) revealed by colposcopic, cytomorphological, and 
ultrasound signs which were assessed according to the following: first group, 44 
patients infected with HPV; second group, 27 HPV-negative patients; and third
group, 30 healthy patients (controls). In cervical specimen, we identified HPV
DNA of different oncogenic risk types by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (JSC SPC 'DiaprofMed') were used
for detecting antibodies to HSV1 and/or HSV2 and for determining the avidity
index. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IFN-α,
TNF-α, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4, IL-10, 
and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), were studied by ELISA.
RESULTS: In HPV-induced cervix precancerous diseases, we identified low-avidity
IgG antibodies to HSV serum of 20 patients; in the serum of 17 patients, we
identified average-avidity antibodies, and high-avidity antibodies were found in 
2 patients only. In 14 HPV-negative patients, we found low-avidity IgG antibodies
to HSV; in 10 patients, medium avidity. Patients with low-avidity IgG antibodies 
to herpes virus showed high and medium oncogenic risk HPV types and a decrease of
IFN-γ compared to patients with medium-avidity IgG antibodies. Production of
IFN-γ was suppressed also in HPV-negative patients with cervical precancers, but 
we found low- and medium-avidity IgG antibodies to herpes virus. In patients with
low-avidity antibodies, we observed increased level of IL-10. Level of IFN-α,
IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-4 did not change in patients of all groups, but TGF-β1
increased.
CONCLUSIONS: In HPV-positive patients, those with low-avidity IgG antibodies to
HSV had immunosuppression, confirmed by increased TGF-β1 and violation of IFN-γ
production. Therefore, in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and IgG antibodies
to HSV, their avidity is an important diagnostic biomarker of HPV-induced
precancerous cervical diseases. Low-avidity IgG antibodies may be an indication
for treatment with immunomodulators and antiviral drugs.

Toll-like receptors 7 and 8 (TLRs) have emerged as key targets in the design of
small molecule adjuvants and stimulants for use in immunotherapies. This study
examines the structure-activity relationship of a series of C2- and
N1-substituted C7-methoxycarbonylimidazoquinolines to gain insight to the
structural basis to TLR-7 and -8 selective activity. The analysis is further
applied to evaluate the induction of multiple cytokines, including IL-10, IL-12, 
IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-α, and IFN-γ, using murine BMDCs and human PBMCs. The results
show TLR-7/8 activity is correlated to the C2-alkyl chain length, with peak
activity occurring for the butyl (TLR-7) and pentyl (TLR-8) derivatives. A
similar SAR is identified in the production of IL-1β, IL-12, and IFN-γ, which are
shown to depend on both the C2-alkyl chain length and substitution to the
N1-position. The compounds were also potent stimulators of IFN-α and IL-10
production but with less pronounced structure-based correlations.

(+)-Catechin is a type of catechin present in large amounts in açaí fruits and
cocoa seeds. Besides its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, little is 
known about its effects in the liver, especially during hepatic fibrosis. We
report here the effects of (+)-catechin on hepatic stellate cells. (+)-Catechin
induced quiescent phenotype in GRX cells, along with an increase in lipid
droplets. Proliferator-activated receptor γ mRNA expression was upregulated,
whereas type I collagen mRNA expression was downregulated. Pro-inflammatory
cytokines were not influenced by (+)-catechin, whereas the levels of interleukin 
10 were significantly increased. The data provide evidence that (+)-catechin can 
reduce hepatic stellate cell activation.

Oral Escherichia coli colonization factor antigen I fimbriae ameliorate arthritis
via IL-35, not IL-27.

A Salmonella therapeutic expressing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli colonization
factor Ag I (CFA/I) fimbriae protects against collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) by
eliciting two regulatory T cell (Treg) subsets: TGF-β-producing
Foxp3(-)CD39(+)CD4(+) T cells and IL-10-producing Foxp3(+)CD39(+)CD4(+) T cells. 
However, it is unclear whether CFA/I fimbriae alone are protective and whether
other regulatory cytokines are involved, especially in the context for the
EBI3-sharing cytokines, Treg-derived IL-35 and APC-derived IL-27, both capable of
suppressing Th17 cells and regulating autoimmune diseases. Subsequent evaluation 
revealed that a single oral dose of purified, soluble CFA/I fimbriae protected
against CIA as effectively as did Salmonella-CFA/I and found that
Foxp3(+)CD39(+)CD4(+) T cells were the source of secreted IL-35, whereas IL-27
production by CD11c(+) cells was inhibited. Inquiring into their relevance, CFA/I
fimbriae-treated IL-27R-deficient (WSX-1(-/-)) mice were equally protected
against CIA as were wild-type mice, suggesting a limited role for IL-27. In
contrast, CFA/I fimbriae-mediated protection was abated in EBI3(-/-) mice,
accompanied by the loss of TGF-β- and IL-10-producing Tregs. Adoptive transfer of
C57BL/6 CD39(+)CD4(+) T cells to EBI3(-/-) mice with concurrent CFA/I plus IL-35 
treatment effectively stimulated Tregs suppressing proinflammatory collagen
II-specific Th cells. In contrast, recipients cotransferred with C57BL/6 and
EBI3(-/-) CD39(+)CD4(+) T cells and treated with CFA/I plus IL-35 were not
protected, implicating the importance of endogenous IL-35 for conferring
CFA/I-mediated protection. Thus, CFA/I fimbriae stimulate IL-35 required for the 
coinduction of TGF-β and IL-10.

Insulin inhibits IL-10-mediated regulatory T cell function: implications for
obesity.

Chronic inflammation is known to promote metabolic dysregulation in obesity and
type 2 diabetes. Although the precise origin of the unchecked inflammatory
response in obesity is unclear, it is known that overproduction of
proinflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells affects metabolism. For example,
TNF-α contributes to the inability of cells to respond to insulin and to the
increase in levels of insulin. Whether this hyperinsulinemia itself is part of a 
feedback loop that affects the progression of chronic adipose inflammation is
unknown. In this article, we show that regulatory T cells (Tregs) express the
insulin receptor, and that high levels of insulin impair the ability of Tregs to 
suppress inflammatory responses via effects on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
Insulin activated AKT signaling in Tregs, leading to inhibition of both IL-10
production and the ability of Tregs to suppress the production of TNF-α by
macrophages in a contact-independent manner. The effect of insulin on Treg
suppression was limited to IL-10 production and it did not alter the expression
of other proteins associated with Treg function, including CTLA-4, CD39, and
TGF-β. In a model of diet-induced obesity, Tregs from the visceral adipose tissue
of hyperinsulinemic, obese mice showed a similar specific decrease in IL-10
production, as well as a parallel increase in production of IFN-γ. These data
suggest that hyperinsulinemia may contribute to the development of
obesity-associated inflammation via a previously unknown effect of insulin on the
IL-10-mediated function of Tregs.

Secondary hypoxia is a known contributor to adverse outcomes in patients with
traumatic brain injury (TBI). Based on the evidence that hypoxia and TBI in
isolation induce neuroinflammation, we investigated whether TBI combined with
hypoxia enhances cerebral cytokine production. We also explored whether increased
concentrations of injury biomarkers discriminate between hypoxic (Hx) and
normoxic (Nx) patients, correlate to worse outcome, and depend on blood-brain
barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Forty-two TBI patients with Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8 were
recruited. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were collected over 6 days.
Patients were divided into Hx (n=22) and Nx (n=20) groups. Eight cytokines were
measured in the CSF; albumin, S100, myelin basic protein (MBP) and neuronal
specific enolase (NSE) were quantified in serum. CSF/serum albumin quotient was
calculated for BBB function. Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) was assessed
at 6 months post-TBI. Production of granulocye macrophage-colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) was higher, and profiles of GM-CSF, interferon (IFN)-γ and, to a 
lesser extent, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), were prolonged in the CSF of Hx but
not Nx patients at 4-5 days post-TBI. Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10
increased similarly in both Hx and Nx groups. S100, MBP, and NSE were
significantly higher in Hx patients with unfavorable outcome. Among these three
biomarkers, S100 showed the strongest correlations to GOSE after TBI-Hx. Elevated
CSF/serum albumin quotients lasted for 5 days post-TBI and displayed similar
profiles in Hx and Nx patients. We demonstrate for the first time that post-TBI
hypoxia is associated with prolonged neuroinflammation, amplified extravasation
of biomarkers, and poor outcome. S100 and MBP could be implemented to track the
occurrence of post-TBI hypoxia, and prompt adequate treatment.

Potent vaccine efficiency is crucial for disease control in both human and
livestock vaccination programmes. Free range chickens and chickens with access to
outdoor areas have a high risk of infection with parasites including Ascaridia
galli, a gastrointestinal nematode with a potential influence on the
immunological response to vaccination against other infectious diseases. The
purpose of this study was to investigate whether A. galli infection influences
vaccine-induced immunity to Newcastle Disease (ND) in chickens from an
MHC-characterized inbred line. Chickens were experimentally infected with A.
galli at 4 weeks of age or left as non-parasitized controls. At 10 and 13 weeks
of age half of the chickens were ND-vaccinated and at 16 weeks of age, all
chickens were challenged with a lentogenic strain of Newcastle disease virus
(NDV). A. galli infection influenced both humoral and cell-mediated immune
responses after ND vaccination. Thus, significantly lower NDV serum titres were
found in the A. galli-infected group as compared to the non-parasitized group
early after vaccination. In addition, the A. galli-infected chickens showed
significantly lower frequencies of NDV-specific T cells in peripheral blood three
weeks after the first ND vaccination as compared to non-parasitized chickens.
Finally, A. galli significantly increased local mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-13
and significantly decreased TGF-ß4 expression in the jejunum two weeks after
infection with A. galli. At the time of vaccination (six and nine weeks after A. 
galli infection) the local expression in the jejunum of both IFN-? and IL-10 was 
significantly decreased in A. galli-infected chickens. Upon challenge with the
NDV LaSota strain, viral genomes persisted in the oral cavity for a slightly
longer period of time in A. galli-infected vaccinees as compared to
non-parasitized vaccinees. However, more work is needed in order to determine if 
vaccine-induced protective immunity is impaired in A. galli-infected chickens.

Macrophages are versatile cells of the immune system which react to various
external stimuli through different polarization patterns which adjust the cells
to the required function whether it is removal of pathogens or necrotic cells,
tissue repair or propagation of inflammation. As much of macrophage behavior is
determined by their polarization, appropriate models to study macrophage
polarization are required. Previously we have published a protocol for
transfection of THP-1 macrophages, which in brief pre-differentiates THP-1
monocytes for 48h using 100ng/ml PMA, followed by detachment of the cells and
eletroporation using Lonza nucleofector technology and finally includes further
48h of differentiation with 100ng/ml PMA. When we applied this protocol to study 
interleukin (IL) 10 dependent polarization, the cells were inert to the IL10
stimulus, as indicated by a failure to induce IL10 target genes such as SOCS3.
Further investigation revealed that the cells were classically activated by the
differentiation agent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as shown by induction
of chemokine receptor CCR7. Subsequent reduction of PMA concentration during
THP-1 macrophage differentiation significantly improved their response to IL10 as
SOCS3 increased more than 40-fold. This increased responsiveness of the THP-1
macrophages was also confirmed for polarization with LPS and IFNγ. Up-regulation 
of classical activation markers CCL3, CCR7 and TNFα was enhanced from 18-, 21-
and 70-fold, respectively, to 48-, 222- and 951-fold, respectively. Reduction of 
PMA concentration did not negatively affect macrophage differentiation or
transfection efficiency. Expression of macrophage differentiation markers CD11b
and CD68 as well as cell morphology remained unchanged. In addition transfection 
efficiency and rates of apoptosis and necrosis remained unaffected. Thus our
revised protocol combines high transfection efficiency and cell vitality with a
strong response to polarizing stimuli and therefore constitutes a suitable model 
for studying macrophage polarization in vitro.

RATIONALE: We attenuated virulent Bordetella pertussis by genetically eliminating
or detoxifying three major toxins. This strain, named BPZE1, is being developed
as a possible live nasal vaccine for the prevention of whooping cough. It is
immunogenic and safe when given intranasally in adult volunteers.
OBJECTIVES: Before testing in human infants, we wished to examine the potential
effect of BPZE1 on a common pediatric infection (respiratory syncytial virus
[RSV]) in a preclinical model.
METHODS: BPZE1 was administered before or after RSV administration in adult or
neonatal mice. Pathogen replication, inflammation, immune cell recruitment, and
cytokine responses were measured.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: BPZE1 alone did not cause overt disease, but
induced efflux of neutrophils into the airway lumen and production of IL-10 and
IL-17 by mucosal CD4(+) T cells. Given intranasally before RSV infection, BPZE1
markedly attenuated RSV, preventing weight loss, reducing viral load, and
attenuating lung cell recruitment. Given neonatally, BPZE1 also protected against
RSV-induced weight loss even through to adulthood. Furthermore, it markedly
increased IL-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and natural killer cells and
recruited regulatory cells and neutrophils after virus challenge. Administration 
of anti-IL-17 antibodies ablated the protective effect of BPZE1 on RSV disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Rather than enhancing RSV disease, BPZE1 protected against viral
infection, modified viral responses, and enhanced natural mucosal resistance.
Prevention of RSV infection by BPZE1 seems in part to be caused by induction of
IL-17. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01188512).

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play important
roles in the immune escape of cancer. In this study, we investigated pDCs and
pDC-induced inducible costimulator (ICOS)(+) Treg populations in peripheral blood
from gastric cancer (GC) patients and healthy donors by flow cytometry. The
distribution of these cells in carcinoma tissue, peritumor tissue, and normal
gastric mucosa was detected by immunohistochemistry. Plasma and tissue
concentration of the cytokines such as interleukin-10 and transforming growth
factor-β1 were also measured. We found that the numbers of pDCs, Tregs, and
ICOS(+) Tregs in peripheral blood were increased in GC patients compared with
healthy donors. In tissue, Tregs and ICOS(+) Tregs were found distributing mainly
in carcinoma tissue, whereas pDCs were mainly found in peritumor tissue.
Moreover, the Foxp3(+) ICOS(+) /Foxp3(+) cell ratio in carcinoma and peritumor
tissue were higher than that in normal tissue. There were more ICOS(+) Tregs in
tumor and peritumor tissue of late-stage GC patients. There was a positive
correlation between pDCs and ICOS(+) Tregs in peripheral blood and peritumor
tissue from GC patients. In conclusion, pDCs may play a potential role in
recruiting ICOS(+) Tregs, and both participate in the immunosuppression
microenvironment of GC.

In a Salmonella challenge study of weaned piglets supplemented with the probiotic
Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (SF68), we observed a delayed, post-infection
proliferative response of purified blood mononuclear cell fractions towards
Salmonella antigens. In order to clarify this observation, we examined the
patterns of immune-associated gene expression in long-term feeding trials of both
pre- and post-weaning piglets. Piglets supplemented with E. faecium NCIMB 10415
showed a post-weaning dysregulation in the expression patterns of both pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in intestinal tissues and spleen. Piglets
of the supplemented group showed significantly reduced levels of IL-8, IL-10 and 
the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 mRNA expression in ileal Peyer's patches. The
expression of CTLA4, an inhibitor of T-cell activation/proliferation, showed
similar levels of expression in all tissues examined, particularly in ileal
Peyer's patches post-weaning where IL-8, IL-10 and CD86 transcript levels were
significantly reduced relative to control animals. Blood serum cytokine protein
levels showed elevated TGFβ in pre-weaning piglets which, together with IL-6, may
have suppressed IFNγ production in the probiotic-fed animals. In a second
Salmonella challenge study, post-weaning, E. faecium-fed animals showed
significantly elevated levels of IL-8 gene expression in mesenteric lymph nodes, 
but reduced levels in the spleen. At early times post-infection, the
probiotic-fed group showed similar levels of IL-10, CD86 and CTLA4 mRNA
expression as the control animals in intestinal Peyer's Patches, despite high
relative levels of IL-8 expression in mesenteric lymph nodes. The sum of the
observations suggests that supplementation of pre-weaning piglets with E. faecium
affects intestinal immune-associated gene expression, which is aggravated
post-weaning when the animals receive increased levels of the probiotic in feed. 
We suggest the post-weaning reductions in gene expression may delay the host
response to infections, and provide pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella with a
"window of opportunity", leading to the increased bacterial loads and shedding
observed in challenge trials. Possible mechanisms explaining these effects of E. 
faecium NCIMB 10415 are discussed.

AIMS: The present study aimed to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory and 
anti-nociceptive effects of carvacryl acetate, a derivative of carvacrol, in
mice.
MAIN METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using various
phlogistic agents that induce paw edema, peritonitis model, myeloperoxidase (MPO)
activity, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. Evaluation of
antinociceptive activity was conducted through acetic acid-induced writhing, hot 
plate test, formalin test, capsaicin and glutamate tests, as well as evaluation
of motor performance on rotarod test.
KEY FINDINGS: Pretreatment of mice with carvacryl acetate (75 mg/kg)
significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema (P<0.05) when compared to
vehicle-treated group. Likewise, carvacryl acetate (75 mg/kg) strongly inhibited 
edema induced by histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin E2 and compound 48/80. In
the peritonitis model, carvacryl acetate significantly decreased total and
differential leukocyte counts, and reduced levels of myeloperoxidase and
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in the peritoneal exudate. The levels of IL-10, an
anti-inflammatory cytokine, were enhanced by carvacryl acetate. Pretreatment with
carvacryl acetate also decreased the number of acetic acid-induced writhing,
increased the latency time of the animals on the hot plate and decreased paw
licking time in the formalin, capsaicin and glutamate tests. The pretreatment
with naloxone did not reverse the carvacryl acetate-mediated nociceptive effect.
SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that carvacryl
acetate exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in mice by reducing inflammatory
mediators, neutrophil migration and cytokine concentration, and anti-nociceptive 
activity due to the involvement of capsaicin and glutamate pathways.

BACKGROUND: Strategies to prevent xenograft rejection while minimizing long-term 
immunosuppression need to be developed for successful xenotransplantaion.
Polyclonally expanded human regulatory T cells (Treg) are known to suppress
xenogeneic responses in vivo and in vitro. However, the risk of opportunistic
infection and malignancy and the requirement for large numbers of Treg for
effective suppression remain drawbacks to their clinical application. This study 
aimed to expand human Treg with xenoantigen stimulation and to assess their
effectiveness at suppressing the xenoimmune response.
METHODS: Human CD4CD25CD127 Treg were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads,
interleukin (IL)-2, and rapamycin for polyclonal expansion. After 7 days, Treg
were further expanded with two subsequent cycles of either polyclonal stimulation
or xenoantigen stimulation with irradiated porcine peripheral blood mononuclear
cells with or without anti-pig SLA CII monoclonal antibody. Treg phenotype and
suppressive capacity were assessed after xenoantigen stimulation.
RESULTS: Porcine xenoantigen-stimulated Treg retained Treg phenotype but had an
increased expression of human leukocyte antigen-DR, inducible costimulator, and
CD45RO when compared with their polyclonally stimulated counterparts. In a
pig-human mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), xenoantigen-stimulated Treg
demonstrated an enhanced suppressive capacity at higher ratios of responder
cells:Treg and secreted higher concentrations of IL-10 and IL-35, although they
were equally suppressive as polyclonally stimulated Treg in an allogeneic or
polyclonal MLR. When Treg expanded in the presence of anti-pig SLA monoclonal
antibody were used in the same pig-human MLR, their suppressive capacity was
reduced substantially.
CONCLUSIONS: Xenoantigen-stimulated Treg show enhanced suppressive capacity in
the pig-human MLR most likely via an IL-10-mediated pathway.

Signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), also known as SHPS-1/SIRPA, is an
immunoglobulin superfamily protein that binds to the protein tyrosine
phosphatases Shp1 and Shp2 through its cytoplasmic region and is predominantly
expressed in dendritic cells and macrophages. CD47, a widely expressed
transmembrane protein, is a ligand for SIRPα, with the two proteins constituting 
a cell-cell communication system. It was previously demonstrated that the
CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway is important for prevention of clearance by splenic 
macrophages of red blood cells or platelets from the bloodstream. In addition,
this signaling pathway is also implicated in homeostatic regulation of dendritic 
cells and development of autoimmunity. Here we describe the detailed protocols
for methods that were used in our recent studies to study the role of the
CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway in autoimmunity. We also demonstrate that
hematopoietic SIRPα as well as nonhematopoietic CD47 are important for
development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Thus, we here
strengthen the importance of experimental animal models as well as other methods 
for the study of molecular pathogenesis of autoimmunity.

CD8 T cell exhaustion in human visceral leishmaniasis.

Pradesh, India.

Little is known about CD8 T cells in human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and it is 
unclear if these cells have a protective, pathological and/or suppressive
function. In experimental VL CD8 T cells have been shown to contribute to
parasite control and play an important role in vaccine-generated immunity. To
better understand the role of CD8 T cells in human VL, we examined molecules
associated with anergy and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenic aspirates (SA), and in CD8 cells derived
from these tissues. Gene and surface marker expression suggest that splenic CD8
cell predominantly display an anergic phenotype, whereas CD8-PBMC have features
of both anergic cells and CTLs. CD8 cells contribute to the baseline IFNγ levels 
in whole blood (WB) and SA cultures, but not to the Leishmania induced IFNγ
release that is revealed using WB cultures. Blockade of CTLA-4 or PD1 had no
effect on IFNγ production or parasite survival in SA cultures. Following cure,
CD8 T cells contribute to the Leishmania induced IFNγ production observed in
Leishmania stimulated cell cultures. We suggest CD8 T cells are driven to
anergy/exhaustion in human VL, which affect their ability to contribute to
protective immune responses.

Cocoa products present great health potential due to their high content of
polyphenols, mainly of flavanols. However, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and
other health effects of regularly consuming cocoa products seem to depend on the 
intake and health status of the consumer, etc. and need to be further clarified. 
A randomised, controlled, cross-over, free-living study was carried out in
healthy (n 24) and moderately hypercholesterolaemic (>2000 mg/l, n 20) subjects
to assess the influence of regularly consuming (4 weeks) two servings (15 g each)
of a cocoa product rich in fibre (containing 33·9 % of total dietary fibre (TDF) 
and 13·9 mg/g of soluble polyphenols) in milk v. consuming only milk (control) on

capacity and free radical-scavenging capacity, (3) IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10,
IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and vascular and intracellular cell
adhesion molecule levels, and (4) systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart
rate. Throughout the study, the diet and physical activity of the volunteers, as 
well as any possible changes in weight or other anthropometric parameters, were
also evaluated. The intake of TDF increased (P< 0·001) to the recommended levels.
Serum HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased (P< 0·001), whereas glucose
(P= 0·029), IL-1β (P= 0·001) and IL-10 (P= 0·001) levels were decreased. The rest
of the studied cardiovascular parameters, as well as the anthropometric ones,
remained similar. In conclusion, regularly consuming a cocoa product with milk
improves cardiovascular health by increasing HDL-C levels and inducing
hypoglycaemic and anti-inflammatory effects in healthy and hypercholesterolaemic 
individuals without causing weight gain.

Glutamine may be a precursor for NO synthesis, which may play a crucial role in
bacterial translocation (BT). The goal of the present study was to investigate
the potential effects of glutamine on BT and the immunological response in an
experimental model of NO synthase inhibition by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester 
(l-NAME). Mice were randomly assigned to four groups: sham; intestinal
obstruction (IO); IO+500 mg/kg per d glutamine (GLN); IO+GLN plus 10 mg/kg per d 
l-NAME (GLN/LN). The groups were pretreated for 7 d. BT was induced by ileal
ligation and was assessed 18 h later by measuring the radioactivity of
99mTc-Escherichia coli in the blood and organs. Mucosal damage was determined
using a histological analysis. Intestinal permeability (IP) was assessed by
measuring the levels of 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in the blood at 
4, 8 and 18 h after surgery. IgA and cytokine concentrations were determined by
ELISA in the intestinal fluid and plasma, respectively. BT was increased in the
GLN/LN and IO groups than in the GLN and sham groups. IP and intestinal mucosa
structure of the sham, GLN and GLN/LN groups were similar. The GLN group had the 
highest levels of interferon-γ, while IL-10 and secretory IgA levels were higher 
than those of the IO group but similar to those of the GLN/LN group. The present 
results suggest that effects of the glutamine pathway on BT were mediated by NO. 
The latter also interferes with the pro-inflammatory systemic immunological
response. On the other hand, IP integrity preserved by the use of glutamine is
independent of NO.
