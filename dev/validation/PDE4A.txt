BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an etiologically refractory
inflammatory disease, accompanied by dysfunction of epithelial barrier and
intestinal inflammation. PDE4 serves as an intracellular proinflammatory enzyme
targeting for degradation of cAMP. Though PDE4 inhibitors have been approved for 
pulmonary and dermatological diseases, the role of PDE4 inhibition in modulating 
mucosal immunity remains elusive. This study was designed to explore whether PDE4
inhibition by apremilast exerts protective effects in DSS-induced murine UC.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Intestinal inflammation and disease severity were
evaluated by morphological, histopathological, biochemical assay and in vivo
imaging examination. Expression of inflammatory mediators, components of
PDE4-mediated pathways in colon and macrophages were determined using
quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA, Luminex assay, immunostaining or western blot,
along with SiRNA knockdown. Immune cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and colonic
lamina propria were analyzed by flow cytometry.
KEY RESULTS: Apremilast significantly attenuated clinical features of UC, as
shown by suppression of microscopic colon damage, inflammatory mediators
production, oxidative stresses and fibrosis. Apremilast also promoted epithelial 
barrier function and inhibited infiltration of immune cells to the inflamed
tissues, through decreasing expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors.
Furthermore, in UC, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4D were observed to highly express in colon 
and apremilast not only inhibited PDE4 isoforms expression, but also activated
PKA-CREB and Epac-Rap1 pathway and subsequently suppressed MAPK, NF-κB,
PI3K-mTOR, and JAK-STAT-SOCS3 activation.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: PDE4 inhibition by apremilast exerted protective
effects in UC via interfering with mucosal immunity, which represented a
promising strategy for regulating intestinal inflammation.

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) shape local cAMP gradients to underpin the specificity 
of receptor function. Key to this process is the highly defined nature of the
intra-cellular location of PDEs in the cell. PDE4A5 is a PDE isoform that
specifically degrades cAMP and is known to associate with the p75 neurotrophin
receptor (p75NTR) where it modulates cAMP signalling cascades that regulate
extracellular matrix remodelling in the lungs. Here we map and validate novel
protein-protein interaction sites that are important for formation of the
PDE4A5-p75NTR complex and show, for the first time, that phosphorylation of
PDE4A5 by MAPKAPK2 enhances PDE4A5 interaction with p75NTR and that this, in
turn, serves to attenuate fibrin degradation.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic airway
inflammatory diseases that share some common features, although these diseases
are somewhat different in etiologies, clinical features, and treatment policies. 
The aim of this study is to investigate the common microRNA-mediated changes in
bronchial epithelial cells of asthma and COPD. The microRNA profiles in primary
bronchial epithelial cells from asthma (AHBE) and COPD (CHBE) patients and
healthy subjects (NHBE) were analyzed with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and
the significant microRNA changes common in AHBE and CHBE were extracted. The
upregulation of hsa-miR-10a-5p and hsa-miR-146a-5p in both AHBE and CHBE was
confirmed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Using bioinformatic
methods, we further identified putative targets of these microRNAs, which were
downregulated in both AHBE and CHBE: miR-10a-5p might suppress BCL2, FGFR3,
FOXO3, PDE4A, PDE4C, and PDE7A; miR-146a-5p might suppress BCL2, INSR, PDE4D,
PDE7A, PDE7B, and PDE11A. We further validated significantly decreased expression
levels of FOXO3 and PDE7A in AHBE and CHBE than in NHBE with qPCR. Increased
serum miR-146a-5p level was also noted in patients with asthma and COPD as
compared with normal control subjects. In summary, our study revealed possible
mechanisms mediated by miR-10a-5p and miR-146a-5p in the pathogenesis of both
asthma and COPD. The findings might provide a scientific basis for developing
novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

The phosphodiesterase (PDE) is a super family represented by four genes: PDE4A,
B,C, and D causes the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bond of cAMP to yield inactive
AMP. c-AMP catalyzing enzyme predominant in inflammatory and immunomodulatory
cells. Therapy to treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with the use
of PDE4 inhibitors is highly envisaged. Molecular docking experiment with large
dataset of diverse scaffolds has been performed on PDE4 inhibitors to analyze the
role of amino acid responsible for binding and activation of the secondary
transmitters. Apart from the general docking experiment the main focus was to
discover the role of water molecules present in the ligand binding domain. All
the compounds was docked in the PDE4B and PDE4D active cavity to produce the free
binding energy scores and spatial disposition/orientation of chemical groups of
inhibitors around the cavity. Under uniform condition the experiments were
carried out with and without water molecules in the LBD. In presence of water
molecule Roflumilast has more binding affinity (-8.48 Kcal/mol with PDE4B enzyme 
and -8.91 Kcal/mol with PDE4D enzyme) and forms two hydrogen bonds with Gln443
and Glu369 aminoacid with PDE4B and PDE4D enzymes respectively. While in absence 
of water molecule its binding affinity has decreased (-7.3 Kcal/mol with PDE4B
enzyme and -5.17 Kcal/mol with PDE4D enzyme) as well as no H-bond interactions
were observed. Similar observation was observed with clinically tested molecules.
Compounds IC-485, Telafentrine, YM-976 and CDP-840 showed high affinity for PDE4B
in the presence of water and formed hydrogen bonds. These compounds showed
insignificant binding in absence of water molecules with very low values of
binding energy, additionally no hydrogen bonding observed between protein-ligand 
interactions. Gln 443 is the significant amino acid showed hydrogen bonding with 
all the compounds docked in PDE4B. Glu 369 and Thr 333 of PDE4D are common amino 
acid that forms hydrogen bond with ligands. The exhaustive study was carried out 
on the Autodock 4.2 software and explored the role of water molecules present in 
the binding domain.

INTRODUCTION: The primary aim of this study is to understand the binding of
curcumin and its analogues to different PDE4 subtypes and identification of the
role of PDE4 subtype inhibition in the anti-inflammatory property of curcumin.
Docking analysis has been used to acquire the above mentioned structural
information and this has been further used for designing of curcumin derivatives 
with better anti-inflammatory activity.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: Curcumin and its analogues were subjected to docking using 
PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C and PDE4D as the target. A data set comprising of 18
analogues of curcumin was used as ligands for docking of PDE4 subtypes. Curcumin 
was used as the standard for comparison. Docking was performed using AutoDock
Vina 1.1.2 software integrated in LigandScout 4.1. During this process water
molecules were removed from proteins, charges were added and receptor structures 
were minimized by applying suitable force fields. The docking scores were
compared, and the selectivity of compounds for PDE4B over PDE4D were calculated
as well. Key Finding: All curcumin analogues used in the study showed good
binding affinity with all PDE4 subtypes, with evident selectivity towards PDE4B
subtype. The binding of analogue A11 provides the highest binding energy among
all ligands.
CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin and analogues have moderate to strong affinity towards all 
PDE4 subtypes and have evident selectivity towards PDE4B. Oxygen atom of methoxy 
groups plays a key role in protein binding and any alterations could interfere
with the protein binding. Tetrahydropyran side chain and heterocyclic rings are
also suggested to be helpful in protein binding.

Voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels are a prerequisite for signal transmission
at the first olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) synapse within the glomeruli of the
main olfactory bulb (MOB). We showed previously that the N-type Cav channel
subunit Cav2.2 is present in the vast majority of glomeruli and plays a central
role in presynaptic transmitter release. Here, we identify a distinct subset of
glomeruli in the MOB of adult mice that is characterized by expression of the
P/Q-type channel subunit Cav2.1. Immunolocalization shows that Cav2.1+ glomeruli 
reside predominantly in the medial and dorsal MOB, and in the vicinity of the
necklace glomerular region close to the accessory olfactory bulb. Few glomeruli
are detected on the ventral and lateral MOB. Cav2.1 labeling in glomeruli
colocalizes with the presynaptic marker vGlut2 in the axon terminals of OSNs.
Electron microscopy shows that Cav2.1+ presynaptic boutons establish
characteristic asymmetrical synapses with the dendrites of second-order neurons
in the glomerular neuropil. Cav2.1+ glomeruli receive axonal input from OSNs that
express molecules of canonical OSNs: olfactory marker protein, the ion channel
Cnga2, and the phosphodiesterase Pde4a. In the main olfactory epithelium, Cav2.1 
labels a distinct subpopulation of OSNs whose distribution mirrors the topography
of the MOB glomeruli, that shows the same molecular signature, and is already
present at birth. Together, these experiments identify a unique Cav2.1+
multiglomerular domain in the MOB that may form a previously unrecognized
olfactory subsystem distinct from other groups of necklace glomeruli that rely on
cGMP signaling mechanisms.

One of the major pathological outcomes of DNA damage during aging or anticancer
therapy is enhanced inflammation. However, the underlying signaling mechanism
that drives this is not well understood. Here, we show that in response to DNA
damage, ubiquitously expressed GPCR, CXCR4 is upregulated through the ATM
kinase-HIF1α dependent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, and enhances
inflammatory response when activated by its ligand, chemokine CXCL12. A
pharmacologically active compound screen revealed that this increased
inflammation is dependent on reduction in cAMP levels achieved through activation
of Gαi through CXCR4 receptor and PDE4A. Through in vivo analysis in mice where
DNA damage was induced by irradiation, we validated that CXCR4 is induced
systemically after DNA damage and inhibition of its activity or its induction
blocked inflammation as well as tissue injury. We thus report a unique DNA
damage-linked inflammatory cascade, which is mediated by expression level changes
in a GPCR and can be targeted to counteract inflammation during anticancer
therapies as well as aging.

Autophagy promotes invasion of hepatocarcinoma cells through transforming growth 
factor (TGF)-β-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study
investigated the mechanism by which autophagy induces TGF-β-triggered EMT and
invasion of hepatocarcinoma cells. Autophagy was induced in HepG2 and BEL7402
cells by starvation in Hank's balanced salt solution. Induction of autophagy
degraded phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4A and increased intracellular cAMP, PKA
activity and PKA phosphorylation, resulting in increased cAMP response element
binding (CREB) phosphorylation in hepatocarcinoma cells. Autophagy-induced
activation of cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling further enhanced TGF-β1 expression,
downregulated the expression of epithelial markers and upregulated the expression
of mesenchymal markers, accelerating invasion of hepatocarcinoma cells.
Inhibition of autophagy by Atg3 and Atg7 knockdown or by chloroquine treatment
prevented degradation of PDE4A and activation of cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling,
suppressing TGF-β1 expression, EMT and invasion in hepatocarcinoma cells. In
addition, inhibition of cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling also blocked autophagy-induced
TGF-β1 expression and prevented EMT and invasion of hepatocarcinoma cells under
starvation. Furthermore, exogenous inhibition of PDE4A or activation of
cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling rescued TGF-β1 expression, EMT and invasion in
autophagy-deficient hepatocarcinoma cells. These findings suggest that autophagy 
induces TGF-β1 expression and EMT in hepatocarcinoma cells via cAMP/PKA/CREB
signalling, which is activated by autophagy-dependent PDE4A degradation.

Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) have beneficial effects on memory in
preclinical and clinical studies. Development of these drugs has stalled due to
dose-limiting side effects of nausea and emesis. While use of subtype-selective
inhibitors (i.e., for PDE4A, B, or D) could overcome this issue, conservation of 
the catalytic region, to which classical inhibitors bind, limits this approach.
The present study examined the effects of BPN14770, an allosteric inhibitor of
PDE4D, which binds to a primate-specific, N-terminal region. In mice engineered
to express PDE4D with this primate-specific sequence, BPN14770 was 100-fold more 
potent for improving memory than in wild-type mice; meanwhile, it exhibited low
potency in a mouse surrogate model for emesis. BPN14770 also antagonized the
amnesic effects of scopolamine, increased cAMP signaling in brain, and increased 
BDNF and markers of neuronal plasticity associated with memory. These data
establish a relationship between PDE4D target engagement and effects on memory
for BPN14770 and suggest clinical potential for PDE4D-selective inhibitors.

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) was found to be involved in a variety of cancer
pathologies by modulating the degradation of levels of cAMP/cGMP. However, the
prognostic significance and biological effect of PDE4a in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) have not been understood completely. In the present study, PDE4a 
expression was detected in a cohort of HCC and matched adjacent liver tissues (n 
= 210) by immunohistochemistry staining and Western immunoblotting assay, And in 
vitro experiments were conducted to determine the effect of PDE4a on metastatic
capacity of HCC cells. The data here displayed that the majority of HCC patients 
had higher PDE4a expression in tumor tissues compared to matched adjacent liver
tissues and enhanced PDE4a expression in tumor tissues was associated positively 
with HBV infection, liver cirrhosis, higher serum AFP level, advanced TNM stage, 
vascular embolus, intrahepatic metastases and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). 
Survival analyses suggested that higher PDE4a was indicated the poor prognosis of
HCCs after liver resection. Ectopic expression of PDE4a in Huh7 cells leaded to
significant repression of E-cadherin and up-regulated the expression of
N-cadherin and Vimentin, and facilitated migration and invasion abilities.
Silencing PDE4a in MHCC97h cells acquired the opposite results. Taken together,
PDE4a triggered EMT in HCC cells and acted as a predictive factor candidate and a
potential therapeutic target for HCC.

Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder characterized
by abdominal pain and abnormalities in defecation associated with psychiatric
disorders such as depression and anxiety due to the dysfunction of brain-gut
axis. This study aims to determine whether trans-Resveratrol affects
chronic-acute combined stress (CACS)-induced IBS-like symptoms including
depression, anxiety and intestinal dysfunction. Methods: ICR male mice were
exposed to the CACS for 3 weeks. trans-Resveratrol were administrated daily (2.5,
5, and 10 mg/kg, i.g.) 30 min before CACS. Behavioral tests were performed to
evaluate the treatment effects of trans-Resveratrol on IBS. Hippocampus tissues
were collected and processed Golgi staining and immuno-blot analysis. Ileum and
colon tissues were collected and processed Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and
immuno-blot analysis. Results: Administration with trans-Resveratrol before CACS 
for 3 weeks significantly reversed CACS-induced depression- and anxiety-like
behaviors and intestinal dysfunction in mice, which implied a crucial role of
trans-Resveratrol in treatment of IBS-like disorder. Furthermore,
trans-Resveratrol improved hippocampal neuronal remodeling, protected ileal and
colonic epithelial barrier structure against CACS insults. The further study
suggested that trans-Resveratrol normalized phosphodiesterases 4A (PDE4A)
expression and CREB-BDNF signaling that were disturbed by CACS. The increased
pCREB and BDNF expression in the hippocampus were found, while decreased pCREB
and BDNF levels were observed after treatment with trans-Resveratrol.
Conclusions: The dual effects of trans-Resveratrol on stress-induced psychiatric 
and intestinal dysfunction may be related to normalization of PDE4A expression
and subsequent pCREB-BDNF signaling in the hippocampus, ileum and colon.

Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) play a pivotal role in
nerve-mediated relaxation of the bladder outflow region. In the bladder neck, a
marked phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) expression has also been described and
PDE4 inhibitors, as rolipram, produce smooth muscle relaxation. This study
investigates the role of PDE4 isoenzyme in bladder neck gaseous inhibitory
neurotransmission. We used Western blot and double immunohistochemical staining
for the detection of NPP4 (PDE4) and PDE4A and organ baths for isometric force
recording to roflumilast and tadalafil, PDE4 and PDE5, respectively, inhibitors
in pig and human samples. Endogenous H2S production measurement and electrical
field stimulation (EFS) were also performed. A rich PDE4 and PDE4A expression was
observed mainly limited to nerve fibers of the smooth muscle layer of both
species. Moreover, roflumilast produced a much more potent smooth muscle
relaxation than that induced by tadalafil. In porcine samples, H2S generation was
diminished by H2S and NO synthase inhibition and augmented by roflumilast.
Relaxations elicited by EFS were potentiated by roflumilast. These results
suggest that PDE4, mainly PDE4A, is mostly located within nerve fibers of the pig
and human bladder neck, where roflumilast produces a powerful smooth muscle
relaxation. In pig, the fact that roflumilast increases endogenous H2S production
and EFS-induced relaxations suggests a modulation of PDE4 on NO- and H2S-mediated
inhibitory neurotransmission.

Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are more resilient than those in
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in aging, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's
disease. The current study compared glutamate and neuromodulatory actions in
macaque V1 to those in dlPFC, and found striking regional differences. V1
neuronal firing to visual stimuli depended on AMPA receptors, with subtle NMDA
receptor contributions, while dlPFC depends primarily on NMDA receptors.
Neuromodulatory actions also differed between regions. In V1, cAMP signaling
increased neuronal firing, and the phosphodiesterase PDE4A was positioned to
regulate cAMP effects on glutamate release from axons. HCN channels in V1 were
classically located on distal dendrites, and enhanced cell firing. These data
contrast with dlPFC, where PDE4A and HCN channels are concentrated in thin
spines, and cAMP-HCN signaling gates inputs and weakens firing. These regional
differences may explain why V1 neurons are more resilient than dlPFC neurons to
the challenges of age and disease.

Two cAMP signaling compartments centered on adenylyl cyclase (AC) exist in human 
airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, one containing β2-adrenergic receptor AC6 and 
another containing E prostanoid receptor AC2. We hypothesized that different PDE 
isozymes selectively regulate cAMP signaling in each compartment. According to
RNA-sequencing data, 18 of 24 PDE genes were expressed in primary HASM cells
derived from age- and sex-matched donors with and without asthma. PDE8A was the
third most abundant of the cAMP-degrading PDE genes, after PDE4A and PDE1A.
Knockdown of PDE8A using shRNA evoked twofold greater cAMP responses to 1 μM
forskolin in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Overexpression of AC2
did not alter this response, but overexpression of AC6 increased cAMP responses
an additional 80%. We examined cAMP dynamics in live HASM cells using a
fluorescence sensor. PF-04957325, a PDE8-selective inhibitor, increased basal
cAMP concentrations by itself, indicating a significant basal level of cAMP
synthesis. In the presence of an AC inhibitor to reduce basal signaling,
PF-04957325 accelerated cAMP production and increased the inhibition of cell
proliferation induced by isoproterenol, but it had no effect on cAMP
concentrations or cell proliferation regulated by prostaglandin E2. Lipid raft
fractionation of HASM cells revealed PDE8A immunoreactivity in buoyant fractions 
containing caveolin-1 and AC5/6 immunoreactivity. Thus, PDE8 is expressed in
lipid rafts of HASM cells, where it specifically regulates β2-adrenergic receptor
AC6 signaling without effects on signaling by the E prostanoid receptors 2/4-AC2 
complex. In airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, PDE8 may represent a novel therapeutic target to modulate HASM
responsiveness and airway remodeling.

Consumption of methylxanthine alkaloids appears to induce activities by
antagonizing adenosine receptors, implicated in breast cancer behavior in vitro. 
Our goal was to evaluate expression of genes for methylxanthine receptors and
metabolizing enzymes to assess risk of breast carcinoma recurrence. Clinical
outcomes, estrogen/progestin receptor results, and gene expression assays guided 
selection. RNA was isolated from laser capture microdissection-procured carcinoma
cells for microarray using established protocols. Gene expression levels of eight
methylxanthine receptors, eight metabolizing enzymes, and various
phosphodiesterases were retrieved from microarray results. Univariable Cox
regressions and Kaplan-Meier plots were determined for each gene with R software.
Individually, lower expressions of PDE4A, CYP2A6, or CYP2E were related to
decreased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PDE1A
over-expression predicted decreased PFS and OS. ADORA2B and RYR1 over-expressions
predicted diminished OS. ER+ cancers exhibited lower ADORA1, ADORA2B, and RYR1
and elevated PDE4A, CYP2A6, and CYP2E expressions. Of PR+ carcinomas, diminished 
ADORA2B and RYR1 and elevated expressions of ADORA3, PDE4A, CYP2C8, and CYP2E
were noted. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) revealed that
CYP2E, PDE1A, and PDE4A expressions collectively predicted PFS whereas ADORA1,
CYP2E, PDE1A, PDE1B, and PDE4A expressions jointly predicted OS. Models were
clinically significant when validated externally. LASSO also derived a six-gene
model and five-gene model that predicted PFS of ER- or PR- carcinomas,
respectively. Similarly, five-gene and four-gene models predicted OS in ER- or
PR- carcinomas, respectively. Collectively, expression of genes involved in
methylxanthine action and metabolism in single-cell types predicted clinical
outcomes of breast carcinoma indicating promise for developing diagnostics and
design of new therapeutics.

Urocortin 1 and 2 (Ucn-1 and Ucn-2) have established protective actions against
myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuries. However, little is known about
their role in posttranscriptional regulation in the process of cardioprotection. 
Herein, we investigated whether microRNAs play a role in urocortin-induced
cardioprotection. Administration of Ucn-1 and Ucn-2 at the beginning of
reperfusion significantly restored cardiac function, as evidenced ex vivo in
Langendorff-perfused rat hearts and in vivo in rat subjected to I/R. Experiments 
using microarray and qRT-PCR determined that the addition of Ucn-1 at reperfusion
modulated the expression of several miRNAs with unknown role in cardiac
protection. Ucn-1 enhanced the expression of miR-125a-3p, miR-324-3p; meanwhile
it decreased miR-139-3p. Similarly, intravenous infusion of Ucn-2 in rat model of
I/R mimicked the effect of Ucn-1 on miR-324-3p and miR-139-3p. The effect of
Ucn-1 involves the activation of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-2, Epac2
and ERK1/2. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-125a-3p, miR-324-3p and
miR-139-3p promoted dysregulation of genes expression involved in cell death and 
apoptosis (BRCA1, BIM, STAT2), in cAMP and Ca2+ signaling (PDE4a, CASQ1), in cell
stress (NFAT5, XBP1, MAP3K12) and in metabolism (CPT2, FoxO1, MTRF1, TAZ).
Altogether, these data unveil a novel role of urocortin in myocardial protection,
involving posttranscriptional regulation with miRNAs.

It is increasingly evident that alcohol-induced, gut-mediated peripheral
endotoxemia plays a significant role in glial cell activation and
neuro-inflammation. Using a mouse model of chronic alcohol feeding, we examined
the causal role of endotoxin- and cytokine-responsive Pde4 subfamily b (Pde4b)
expression in alcohol-induced neuro-inflammation. Both pharmacologic and genetic 
approaches were used to determine the regulatory role of Pde4b. In C57Bl/6 wild
type (WT) alcohol fed (WT-AF) animals, alcohol significantly induced peripheral
endotoxemia and Pde4b expression in brain tissue, accompanied by a decrease in
cAMP levels. Further, along with Pde4b, there was a robust activation of
astrocytes and microglia accompanied by significant increases in the inflammatory
cytokines (Tnfα, Il-1β, Mcp-1 and Il-17) and the generalized inflammatory marker 
Cox-2. At the cellular level, alcohol and inflammatory mediators, particularly
LPS, Tnfα and Hmgb1 significantly activated microglial cells (Iba-1 expression)
and selectively induced Pde4b expression with a minimal to no change in Pde4a and
d isoforms. In comparison, the alcohol-induced decrease in brain cAMP levels was 
completely inhibited in WT mice treated with the Pde4 specific pharmacologic
inhibitor rolipram and in Pde4b-/- mice. Moreover, all the observed markers of
alcohol-induced brain inflammation were markedly attenuated. Importantly, glial
cell activation induced by systemic endotoxemia (LPS administration) was also
markedly decreased in Pde4b-/- mice. Taken together, these findings strongly
support the notion that Pde4b plays a critical role in coordinating
alcohol-induced, peripheral endotoxemia mediated neuro-inflammation and could
serve as a significant therapeutic target.

Ovariectomy (OVX) promotes sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ overload in
ventricular myocytes. We hypothesized that the cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway contributes to this Ca2+ dysregulation.
Myocytes were isolated from adult female C57BL/6 mice following either OVX or
sham surgery (surgery at ≈1mos). Contractions, Ca2+ concentrations (fura-2) and
ionic currents were measured simultaneously (37°C, 2Hz) in voltage-clamped
myocytes. Intracellular cAMP levels were determined with an enzyme immunoassay;
phosphodiesterase (PDE) and adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoform expression was examined
with qPCR. Ca2+ currents were similar in myocytes from sham and OVX mice but Ca2+
transients, excitation-contraction (EC)-coupling gain, SR content and
contractions were larger in OVX than sham cells. To determine if the cAMP/PKA
pathway mediated OVX-induced alterations in EC-coupling, cardiomyocytes were
incubated with the PKA inhibitor H-89 (2μM), which abolished baseline
differences. While basal intracellular cAMP did not differ, levels were higher in
OVX than sham in the presence of a non-selective PDE inhibitor (300μM IBMX), or
an AC activator (10μM forskolin). This suggests the production of cAMP by AC and 
its breakdown by PDE were enhanced by OVX. Consistent with this, mRNA levels for 
both AC5 and PDE4A were higher in OVX in comparison to sham. Differences in Ca2+ 
homeostasis and contractions were abolished when sham and OVX cells were dialyzed
with patch pipettes containing the same concentration of 8-bromoadenosine-cAMP
(50μM). Interestingly, selective inhibition of PDE4 increased Ca2+ current only
in OVX cells. Together, these findings suggest that estrogen suppresses SR Ca2+
release and that this is regulated, at least in part, by the cAMP/PKA pathway.
These changes in the cAMP/PKA pathway may promote Ca2+ dysregulation and
cardiovascular disease when ovarian estrogen levels fall. These results advance
our understanding of female-specific cardiomyocyte mechanisms that may affect
responses to therapeutic interventions in older women.

BACKGROUND: It has been shown that hosphodiesterases (PDEs) play an important
role in mediating the smooth muscle tone of rat urinary bladder. However, the
gene expression profiles of them were still unknown.
METHODS: Urinary bladder Strips were obtained from both neonatal and adult
Sprague-Dawley rats. RT-PCR/western blot and organ bath were used to measure the 
expression and function of PDEs.
RESULTS: Adult rat urinary bladder expressed various PDE mRNA with the following 
rank order:
PDE5A ≈ PDE9A ≈ PDE10A > PDE2A ≈ PDE4A ≈ PDE4D > PDE4B ≈ PDE3B ≈ PDE8B ≈ PDE7A ≈ 
PDE7B > PDE1A. PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE3A, PDE4C, PDE8A, and PDE11A were not detected.
Of interest, the mRNA and protein of PDE3A were significantly decreased in adult 
rat urinary bladder compared to neonatal rat urinary bladder. Cilostamide, a
specific inhibitor for PDE3, significantly inhibited the amplitude and frequency 
of carbachol-enhanced phasic contractions of neonatal rat bladder strips by 38.8%
and 12.1%, respectively. Compared to the neonatal rat bladder, the effect of
cilostamide was significantly blunted in adult rat urinary bladder: the amplitude
and frequency of carbachol-enhanced phasic contractions were decreased by 13.4%
(P < 0.01 vs neonatal rat bladder) and 4.4%, respectively. However, the mRNA and 
the protein levels of PDE3B were similar between neonatal and adult rat bladder.
CONCLUSION: We found that several PDE isoforms were expressed in the rat urinary 
bladder with distinct levels. Moreover, we showed that the function of PDE3 was
blunted in adult rat bladder likely due to the decreased expression of PDE3A.

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) may modulate inflammatory pathways, but PDE expression 
is poorly documented in humans with sepsis. Using quantitative PCR on whole blood
leukocytes, we characterized PDE mRNA expression in healthy volunteers (n = 20), 
healthy volunteers given lipopolysaccharide (LPS; n = 18), and critically ill
patients with (n = 20) and without (n = 20) sepsis. PDE4B protein expression was 
also studied in magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)-isolated CD15+ neutrophils
(from 7 healthy volunteers, 5 patients without and 5 with sepsis). We studied
relationships between PDE expression, HLA-DR (mRNA and expression on CD14+
monocytes), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-10 levels. LPS
administration in volunteers was associated with increases in PDE4B and PDE4D and
decreases in PDE4A and PDE7A mRNAs. The observed global down-regulation of the
HLA-DR complex was correlated with PDE7A. Critically ill patients had lower
TNF-α/IL-10 mRNA ratios than the volunteers had and global down-regulation of the
HLA-DR complex. Septic patients had persistently lower mRNA levels of PDE7A,
PDE4A, and 4B (also at a protein level) and decreasing levels of PDE4D over time.
Low PDE4D mRNA levels correlated negatively with HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB. LPS
administration and sepsis are, therefore, associated with different PDE mRNA
expression patterns. The effect of PDE changes on immune dysfunction and HLA-DR

AIMS: Glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells (GCSCs) promote themselves
proliferation by secreting the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in an
autocrine manner, positively regulated by phosphodiesterase IV (PDE4). In the
current study, we investigated the putative cytotoxic effect of bevacizumab, a
VEGFA blocker, alone and in combination with a specific inhibitor of PDE4 called 
rolipram on GCSCs isolated from human surgical tumor specimen with a focus on
PI3K/AKT pathway.
MAIN METHODS: CD133+/CD15+ GCSCs were characterized by flow cytometry and
expanded in a serum-free primary culture system. The cell survival, apoptosis,
and protein expression values were measured using MTT assay, TUNEL staining and
western blot, successively. Intracellular cAMP and free secreted VEGFA levels
were assessed by cAMP enzyme immunoassay and ELISA, respectively.
KEY FINDINGS: Bevacizumab suppressed GCSCs survival with IC50~6.5μg/ml and
enhanced the levels of apoptosis, p53 and cleaved-caspase3 along with a decrease 
in free VEGFA levels and ERKs activation. However, there was no significant
modulation of AKT phosphorylation on serine 473, the intracellular PDE4A, VEGFA
and cAMP levels. More cytotoxicity in co-treated cells coupled with a more
substantial decline in the free VEGFA levels and a greater increase in the
quantities of p53 and cleaved-caspase3 compared to those treated with bevacizumab
alone. Co-treatment reduced phospho-AKT, endogenous VEGFA and PDE4A values but
elevated cAMP levels.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlighted a booster cytotoxic effect of combined
rolipram and bevacizumab treatment on the GCSCs primary culture, suggesting that 
this approach is warranted in treatment of GBMs overexpressing VEGFA and PDE4A.

Chronic respiratory diseases affect millions of people every day. According to
the World Health Organization estimates, ~235 million people suffer from asthma, 
~64 million suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and
millions more suffer from allergic rhinitis around the world. In recent last
years, the first phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, roflumilast, was approved 
as a treatment to reduce the risk of exacerbations in stable and severe COPD
associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of exacerbations. PDE4 exists as
four subtypes (A, B, C, and D) each with a capacity to degrade cAMP, a second
messenger involved in inflammatory responses. PDE4 inhibitors inhibit PDE4
activity, consequently increasing cAMP levels. This results in an
anti-inflammatory effect, improving lung function. Roflumilast is a selective and
non-specific PDE4 inhibitor, with the potential to inhibit all PDE4 isoforms to
some degree. Despite the pharmacological effects of roflumilast, its lack of
specificity can induce side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, and dizziness.
Thus, there is a continuing need to develop more specific inhibitors of the
individual PDE4 subtypes. PDE4B and D inhibitors have been investigated the most,
because the levels of these two subtypes are upregulated in moderate and severe
COPD. Current and new evidences show that PDE4B and D inhibitors are the most
studied, because their expressions are up-regulated in moderate and severe COPD. 
This review highlights the major advantages of the selective specific inhibition 
of PDE4A, B, C, and D versus selective, non-specific inhibitors as treatments for
chronic respiratory diseases.

Inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-specific phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) has been
proposed as a potential treatment for a series of neuropsychological conditions
such as depression, anxiety and memory loss. However, the specific involvement of
each of the PDE4 subtypes (PDE4A, 4B and 4C) in different categories of behavior 
has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we compared the possible
pharmacological effects of PDE4B and PDE4D selective inhibitors, A-33 and
D159687, in mediating neurological function in mice. Both compounds were equally 
potent in stimulating cAMP signaling in the mouse hippocampal cell line HT-22
leading to an increase in CREB phosphorylation. In contrast, A-33 and D159687
displayed distinct neuropharmacological effects in mouse behavioral tests. A-33
has an antidepressant-like profile as indicated by reduced immobility time in the
forced swim and tail suspension tasks, as well as reduced latency to feed in the 
novelty suppressed feeding test. D159687, on the other hand, had a procognitive
profile as it improved memory in the novel object recognition test but had no
antidepressant or anxiolytic benefit. The present data suggests that inhibitors
targeting specific subtypes of PDE4 may exhibit differential pharmacological
effects and aid a more efficient pharmacotherapy towards neuropsychological
conditions.

The Leydig cell physiology displays a circadian rhythm driven by a complex
interaction of the reproductive axis hormones and circadian system. The final
output of this regulatory process is circadian pattern of steroidogenic genes
expression and testosterone production. Aging gradually decreases robustness of
rhythmic testosterone secretion without change in pattern of LH secretion. Here, 
we analyzed effect of aging on circadian variation of cAMP and cGMP signaling in 
Leydig cells. Results showed opposite effect of aging on cAMP and cGMP daily
variation. Reduced amplitude of cAMP circadian oscillation was probably
associated with changed expression of genes involved in cAMP production
(increased circadian pattern of Adcy7, Adcy9, Adcy10 and decreased Adcy3); cAMP
degradation (increased Pde4a, decreased Pde8b, canceled rhythm of Pde4d,
completely reversed circadian pattern of Pde7b and Pde8a); and circadian
expression of protein kinase A subunits (Prkac/PRKAC and Prkar2a). Aging
stimulates expression of genes responsible for cGMP production (Nos2, Gucy1a3 and
Gucy1b3/GUCYB3) and degradation (Pde5a, Pde6a and Pde6h) but the overall net
effect is elevation of cGMP circadian oscillations in Leydig cells. In addition, 
the expression of cGMP-dependent kinase, Prkg1/PRKG1 is up-regulated. It seems
that aging potentiate cGMP- and reduce cAMP-signaling in Leydig cells. Since both
signaling pathways affect testosterone production and clockwork in the cells,
further insights into these signaling pathways will help to unravel disorders
linked to the circadian timing system, aging and reproduction.

The transport of lysosomal enzymes into the lysosomes depends on the
phosphorylation of their chains and the binding of the phosphorylated residues to
mannose-6-phosphate receptors. The efficiency of separation depends more on the
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) than on the activity of the phosphorylation of mannose 
residues and can be determined in vitro. PDEs play important roles in regulation 
of the activation of lysosomes. The expression of proteins was confirmed by
western blotting. All PDE4 series protein expression was reduced in high
concentrations of rolipram. As a result of observing the fluorescence intensity
after rolipram treatment, the lysosomal enzyme was activated at low
concentrations and suppressed at high concentrations. High concentrations of
rolipram recovered the original function. Antimicrobial activity was not shown in
either 10 or 100 µ concentrations of rolipram in treated HeLa cells in vitro.
However, the higher anticancer activity at lower rolipram concentration was shown
in lysosomal enzyme treated with 10 µ of rolipram. The anticancer activity was
confirmed through cathepsin B and D assay. Tranfection allowed examination of the
relationship between PDE4 and lysosomal activity in more detail. Protein
expression was confirmed to be reduced. Fluorescence intensity showed decreased
activity of lysosomes and ROS in cells transfected with the antisense sequences
of PDE4 A, B, C, and D. PDE4A showed anticancer activity, whereas lysosome from
cells transfected with the antisense sequences of PDE4 B, C, and D had decreased 
anticancer activity. These results showed the PDE4 A, B, C, and D are conjunctly 
related with lysosomal activity.

Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) has four subtypes: PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C and PDE4D. The 
expression of PDE4 subtypes in microglial cells and the specific contribution of 
each subtype to inflammation remain unclear. In this study, the expression of
PDE4 subtypes in primary microglial cells was assayed. Primary microglial cells
were then transfected with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) against each
PDE4 subtype. PDE4 subtype A-D knockdown was confirmed by quantitative polymerase
chain reaction. Secreted cytokines in the supernatant and intracellular cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels of transfected cells were measured. The
effect of PDE4B siRNA on the activation of extracellular regulated protein kinase
(ERK) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in microglia was further tested by
western blotting. Results showed that the primary microglial cells expressed all 
four types of PDE4s at the protein level. Transfection with the four siRNAs
inhibited PDE4 subtype A-D mRNA expression, respectively. In primary microglial
cells, treatment with PDE4B siRNA significantly inhibited the expression of tumor
necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, and enhanced the expression of cAMP,
while siRNAs to other subtypes had no significant effects. However, none of the
four siRNAs had any significant effect on the expression of IL-10. Furthermore,
in the PDE4B group, the level of phosphorylated ERK was reduced. Among the four
PDE4 subtypes, PDE4B plays an important role in regulating inflammatory responses
in microglia, potentially through initially regulating the intracellular cAMP
concentration.

Prior investigations showed that increased levels of cyclic AMP down-regulate
lung inflammatory changes, stimulating the interest in phosphodiesterase (PDE)4
as therapeutic target. Here, we described the synthesis, pharmacological profile 
and docking properties of a novel sulfonamide series (5 and 6a-k) designed as
PDE4 inhibitors. Compounds were screened for their selectivity against the four
isoforms of human PDE4 using an IMAP fluorescence polarized protocol. The effect 
on allergen- or LPS-induced lung inflammation and airway hyper-reactivity (AHR)
was studied in A/J mice, while the xylazine/ketamine-induced anesthesia test was 
employed as a behavioral correlate of emesis in rodents. As compared to rolipram,
the most promising screened compound, 6a (LASSBio-448) presented a better
inhibitory index concerning PDE4D/PDE4A or PDE4D/PDE4B. Accordingly, docking
analyses of the putative interactions of LASSBio-448 revealed similar poses in
the active site of PDE4A and PDE4C, but slight unlike orientations in PDE4B and
PDE4D. LASSBio-448 (100 mg/kg, oral), 1 h before provocation, inhibited
allergen-induced eosinophil accumulation in BAL fluid and lung tissue samples.
Under an interventional approach, LASSBio-448 reversed ongoing lung eosinophilic 
infiltration, mucus exacerbation, peribronchiolar fibrosis and AHR by allergen
provocation, in a mechanism clearly associated with blockade of pro-inflammatory 
mediators such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and eotaxin-2. LASSBio-448 (2.5 and 10 mg/kg)
also prevented inflammation and AHR induced by LPS. Finally, the sulfonamide
derivative was shown to be less pro-emetic than rolipram and cilomilast in the
assay employed. These findings suggest that LASSBio-448 is a new PDE4 inhibitor
with marked potential to prevent and reverse pivotal pathological features of
diseases characterized by lung inflammation, such as asthma.

BACKGROUND (OR PURPOSE): Inflammation has an essential role in the pathogenesis
of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Its expression is controlled by
phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Thus, PDE4 inhibitors might be useful therapeutic
targets for MDS.
PATIENTS (OR MATERIALS) AND METHODS: We evaluated the expression of each isoform 
of PDE4 (A, B, C, and D) using transcriptomic profiling and examined the
potential impact on the outcome of patients with MDS in terms of survival and
response to hypomethylating agents. Total RNA was extracted from CD34(+) bone
marrow hematopoietic cells from healthy individuals (n = 10) and patients with
MDS (n = 24) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 19).
RESULTS: The study cohort had a median follow-up period of 21.2 months (range,
0.2-68 months) and a median overall survival of 17.6 months (95% confidence
interval, 9.6-25.6). The main finding of the present study was that PDE4 mean
expression was generally higher in patients with MDS than in healthy individuals.
Also, upregulated PDE4 expression seemed to have a possible negative effect on
survival (P > .05). Moreover, lower, compared with higher, mean PDE4A and PDE4C
expression is indicative of a response to a hypomethylating agent (0.09 and 0.03 
vs. 0.54 and 0.49, respectively; P > .05).
CONCLUSION: These results should be confirmed in a larger patient cohort. PDE4
expression could be an effective potential prognostic factor and therapeutic
target for patients with MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The role of
PDE4 inhibitors should be explored in vitro against MDS cell lines and in
preclinical mouse models of MDS.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: T-helper-type 17 (Th17) cells are involved in autoimmune
tissue damage. CD39 is an ectonucleotidase that catalyzes extracellular ATP/ADP
hydrolysis, culminating in the generation of immunosuppressive adenosine.
Functional CD39 expression confers immunosuppressive properties upon immune
cells. As the proportion of CD39 lymphocytes is decreased in juvenile autoimmune 
liver disease (AILD), we have explored whether decreased CD39 expression is
present on Th17 cells and whether this phenomenon is associated with heightened
effector function and inflammation.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with juvenile AILD (22 autoimmune hepatitis and 16
autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis), 8 disease controls (DC) and 16 healthy
subjects (HS) were studied. Peripheral blood cell phenotype was determined by
flow cytometry; ability to suppress by inhibition of cell proliferation/effector 
cytokine production; ectoenzymatic activity by thin layer chromatography;
expression of adenosine receptor, adenosine deaminase (ADA) and
phosphodiesterases (PDE) by quantitative real-time PCR or by Western Blot.
RESULTS: CD39(+) Th17 (Th17(CD39+)) cells from HS appear activated and contain
high frequencies of lymphocytes producing regulatory cytokines. In AILD, however,
Th17(CD39+) cells are markedly diminished and fail to generate AMP/adenosine,
thereby limiting control of both target cell proliferation and IL-17 production. 
When compared to HS, Th17 cells from AILD patients also show lower A2A adenosine 
receptor expression while displaying similar levels of PDE4A, PDE4B and ADA. Only
rare Th17(CD39+) cells are observed by liver immunohistochemistry.
CONCLUSIONS: Th17(CD39+) cells in juvenile AILD are both quantitatively decreased
and qualitatively deficient. Low levels CD39 and A2A expression may contribute to
the perpetuation of Th17 cell effector properties and unfettered inflammation in 
this disease.

Exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induces inflammatory signals in
salivary glands. We investigated the regulatory role of phosphodiesterase 4
(PDE4) inhibitor rolipram on inflammatory mediators and cholinergic/adrenergic
stimulation-induced intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in salivary acinar and ductal 
cells. Submandibular gland (SMG) expressed PDE4A through 4D mRNA and PDE4 was
localized in the luminal membrane of SMG. LPS induced Ca(2+) signaling and ROS
production in SMG. Treatment with rolipram blocked LPS-induced Ca(2+) increase
and ROS production. The application of histamine evoked Ca(2+) signals and ROS
production, which were attenuated by rolipram in SMG cells. Moreover, LPS-induced
NLRP3 inflammasome and cleaved caspase-1 were inhibited by rolipram. The
inhibitory role of rolipram in ROS-induced Ca(2+) signaling was mainly observed
in acinar cells and not in ductal cells. Rolipram also protected SMG acinar but
not ductal cells from LPS-induced cell membrane damage. In the case of
cholinergic/adrenergic stimulation, carbachol/isoproterenol-induced Ca(2+)
signals were upregulated by the treatment of rolipram in SMG. In the case of
cAMP-dependent ductal bicarbonate secretion by rolipram, no effect was observed
on the modulation of ductal chloride/bicarbonate exchange activity. Rolipram
could suppress the inflammatory signals and could be a potential therapeutic
strategy against LPS-induced inflammation to protect the salivary gland cells.

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found in red wine, has wide spectrum of
pharmacological properties including antioxidative and antiaging activities. Beta
amyloid peptides (Aβ) are known to involve cognitive impairment,
neuroinflammatory and apoptotic processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation
of cAMP and/or cGMP activities can improve memory performance and decrease the
neuroinflammation and apoptosis. However, it remains unknown whether the memory
enhancing effect of resveratrol on AD associated cognitive disorders is related
to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) subtypes and subsequent increases
in intracellular cAMP and/or cGMP activities. This study investigated the effect 
of resveratrol on Aβ1-42-induced cognitive impairment and the participation of
PDE4 subtypes related cAMP or cGMP signaling. Mice microinfused with Aβ1-42 into 
bilateral CA1 subregions displayed learning and memory impairment, as evidenced
by reduced memory acquisition and retrieval in the water maze and retention in
the passive avoidance tasks; it was also significant that neuroinflammatory and
pro-apoptotic factors were increased in Aβ1-42-treated mice. Aβ1-42-treated mice 
also increased in PDE4A, 4B and 4D expression, and decreased in PKA level.
However, PKA inhibitor H89, but not PKG inhibitor KT5823, prevented resveratrol's
effects on these parameters. Resveratrol also reversed Aβ1-42-induced decreases
in phosphorylated cAMP response-element binding protein (pCREB), brain derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-apoptotic factor BCl-2 expression, which were
reversed by H89. These findings suggest that resveratrol reversing Aβ-induced
learning and memory disorder may involve the regulation of neuronal inflammation 
and apoptosis via PDE4 subtypes related cAMP-CREB-BDNF signaling.

We recently reported that olfactory sensory neurons in the dorsal zone of the
mouse olfactory epithelium exhibit drastic location-dependent differences in
cilia length. Furthermore, genetic ablation of type III adenylyl cyclase (ACIII),
a key olfactory signaling protein and ubiquitous marker for primary cilia,
disrupts the cilia length pattern and results in considerably shorter cilia,
independent of odor-induced activity. Given the significant impact of ACIII on
cilia length in the dorsal zone, we sought to further investigate the
relationship between cilia length and ACIII level in various regions throughout
the mouse olfactory epithelium. We employed whole-mount immunohistochemical
staining to examine olfactory cilia morphology in phosphodiesterase (PDE)
1C-/-;PDE4A-/- (simplified as PDEs-/- hereafter) and ACIII-/- mice in which ACIII
levels are reduced and ablated, respectively. As expected, PDEs-/- animals
exhibit dramatically shorter cilia in the dorsal zone (i.e., where the cilia
pattern is found), similar to our previous observation in ACIII-/- mice.
Remarkably, in a region not included in our previous study, ACIII-/- animals (but
not PDEs-/- mice) have dramatically elongated, comet-shaped cilia, as opposed to 
characteristic star-shaped olfactory cilia. Here, we reveal that genetic ablation
of ACIII has drastic, location-dependent effects on cilia architecture in the
mouse nose. These results add a new dimension to our current understanding of
olfactory cilia structure and regional organization of the olfactory epithelium. 
Together, these findings have significant implications for both cilia and sensory
biology.

Hippocampus.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in significant impairments in hippocampal
synaptic plasticity. A molecule critically involved in hippocampal synaptic
plasticity, 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate, is downregulated in the
hippocampus after TBI, but the mechanism that underlies this decrease is unknown.
To address this question, we determined whether phosphodiesterase (PDE)
expression in the hippocampus is altered by TBI. Young adult male Sprague Dawley 
rats received sham surgery or moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion brain
injury. Animals were analyzed by western blotting for changes in PDE expression
levels in the hippocampus. We found that PDE1A levels were significantly
increased at 30 min, 1 h and 6 h after TBI. PDE4B2 and 4D2 were also
significantly increased at 1, 6, and 24 h after TBI. Additionally,
phosphorylation of PDE4A was significantly increased at 6 and 24 h after TBI. No 
significant changes were observed in levels of PDE1B, 1C, 3A, 8A, or 8B between
30 min to 7 days after TBI. To determine the spatial profile of these increases, 
we used immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry at 24 h after TBI. PDE1A and
phospho-PDE4A localized to neuronal cell bodies. PDE4B2 was expressed in neuronal
dendrites, microglia and infiltrating CD11b(+) immune cells. PDE4D was
predominantly found in microglia and infiltrating CD11b(+) immune cells. To
determine if inhibition of PDE4 would improve hippocampal synaptic plasticity
deficits after TBI, we treated hippocampal slices with rolipram, a pan-PDE4
inhibitor. Rolipram partially rescued the depression in basal synaptic
transmission and converted a decaying form of long-term potentiation (LTP) into
long-lasting LTP. Overall, these results identify several possible PDE targets
for reducing hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits and improving cognitive
function acutely after TBI.

The available drug treatment options for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) are
limited. In our previous studies, the in vitro activity of 9-cis retinoic acid
(9-cisRA) on adrenocortical NCI-H295R cells was shown along with its antitumoral 
effects in a small pilot xenograft study. Our aim was to dissect the antitumoral 
effects of 9-cisRA on ACC in a large-scale xenograft study involving mitotane,
9-cisRA and their combination. 43 male SCID mice inoculated with NCI-H295R cells 
were treated in four groups (i. control, ii. 9-cisRA, iii. mitotane, iv. 9-cisRA 
+ mitotane) for 28 days. Tumor size follow-up, histological and
immunohistochemical (Ki-67) analysis, tissue gene expression microarray,
quantitative real-time-PCR for the validation of microarray results and to detect
circulating microRNAs were performed. Protein expression was studied by
proteomics and Western-blot validation. Only mitotane alone and the combination
of 9-cisRA and mitotane resulted in significant tumor size reduction. The Ki-67
index was significantly reduced in both 9-cisRA and 9-cisRA+mitotane groups. Only
modest changes at the mRNA level were found: the 9-cisRA-induced overexpression
of apolipoprotein A4 and down-regulation of phosphodiesterase 4A was validated.
The expression of circulating hsa-miR-483-5p was significantly reduced in the
combined treatment group. The SET protein was validated as being significantly
down-regulated in the combined mitotane+9-cisRA group. 9-cisRA might be a helpful
additive agent in the treatment of ACC in combination with mitotane. Circulating 
hsa-miR-483-5p could be utilized for monitoring the treatment efficacy in ACC
patients, and the treatment-induced reduction in protein SET expression might
raise its relevance in ACC biology.

Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) exists as multiple molecular forms. Of 
the 11 families of PDE identified so far, PDE4, a cAMP-specific PDE, has been
identified as the major isoform regulating inflammatory activity. The principle
aim of the present study was to determine whether human basophils and human lung 
mast cells express PDE4. Four sub-classes of PDE4 (A, B, C, and D) have been
identified and expression of these was determined by RT-CPR and by western
blotting. In basophils, prominent expression of mRNA for PDE4A and PDE4D was
observed whereas little if any expression of PDE4B and PDE4C was detected. These 
findings were paralleled by immunoblotting experiments as human basophils were
found to express PDE4A and PDE4D with little evidence for the presence of either 
PDE4B or PDE4C. By contrast, human lung mast cells expressed very little, if any,
mRNA for PDE4 sub-classes although, in some preparations, some modest levels of
mRNA for PDE4D were detected. However, there was no evidence, at the protein
level, that mast cells express PE4. Overall, these data indicate that basophils
express PDE4 (4A and 4D) whereas human lung mast cells do not.

Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is an adenosine cyclic 3,5-monophosphate-specific
degradative enzyme, which is closely associated with the inflammatory response.
Among its four subtypes (A-D), it remains unclear which one exerts suppressive
effects on inflammation and reduces neuropathic pain. The present study aimed to 
examine the modulation of neuroinflammation by PDE4 subtypes in the spinal cord
of a rat model of L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL)-induced neuropathic pain. The
expression levels of PDE4A-D were measured in the lumbar spinal cords of naïve
rats. The rats were then divided into seven groups: The sham group (sham surgery 
+ saline), the saline group (SNL + saline), the vehicle group (SNL +
Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX), the mismatch small interfering (si)RNA group (SNL +
mismatch siRNA), the PDE4A-siRNA group (SNL + PDE4A-siRNA), the PDE4B-siRNA group
(SNL + PDE4B-siRNA) and the PDE4D-siRNA group (SNL + PDE4D-siRNA). In order to
determine behavioral changes, mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal
withdrawal latency (TWL) were recorded. The mRNA and protein expression levels of
PDE4s were also detected. Furthermore, the association between behavioral changes
and individual subtypes of PDE4 were studied following intrathecal administration
of PDE4A, B and D-specific siRNA. The expression levels of protein kinases,
including phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK), and
inflammatory cytokines were measured, in order to explore the underlying
mechanisms. Subtypes A, B and D, but not C, were detected in the naïve rats.
After SNL, both MWT and TWL were reduced. The mRNA and protein expression levels 
of PDE4A, B and D were significantly upregulated after 2, 4, 6 and 8 days of SNL.
Subtype-specific siRNA significantly suppressed the elevated expression levels;
however, only rats treated with PDE4B siRNA exhibited improved MWT and TWL.
Further analysis of the PDE4B siRNA-treated rats demonstrated that 8 days after
SNL, the intensity of p-ERK was reduced, the expression levels of CD11b and glial
fibrillary acidic protein GFAP were reduced, as well as the expression levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β
and IL-6. These results suggested that selective inhibition of PDE4B may relieve 
neuropathic pain, potentially via the suppression of glial activation and the
release of cytokines in the spinal cord.

In Eukaryotes, more than 100 different phosphodiesterase (PDE) proteins serve to 
fine-tune cyclic nucleotide (cAMP and cGMP) signals and contribute to specificity
of signaling. In mammals, PDEs are divided into 11 families, of which PDE4
represents the largest family. Four genes (pde4a, pde4b, pde4c and pde4d) encode 
for this class of enzymes in mammals and give rise to more than 20 variants.
Within this family of genes, PDE4D was discovered on the basis of its regulatory 
properties and its induction by hormones and cAMP. PDE4D has often been used as
the prototype PDE4 and large body of work has been generated on the biochemical, 
pharmacological, and physiological properties of this enzyme. This review covers 
the regulation of PDE4D by phosphorylation, the impact of this regulation in the 
context of the structure of this protein, and the functional consequences of this
complex pattern of posttranslational modifications.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of lung airways, and pharmacological
inhibitors of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) 
have been considered as therapeutics for the treatment of asthma. However,
development of PDE4 inhibitors in clinical trials has been hampered because of
the severe side effects of non-selective PDE4 inhibitors. Here, screening of a
plant extract library in conjunction with dereplication technology led to
identification of baicalin as a new type of PDE4-selective inhibitor. We
demonstrated that while rolipram inhibited the enzyme activity of a range of PDE4
subtypes in in vitro enzyme assays, baicalin selectively inhibited the enzyme
activity of PDE4A and 4B. In addition, baicalin suppressed
lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α expression in macrophage where PDE4B plays a key
role in lipopolysaccharide-induced signaling. Furthermore, baicalin treatment in 
an animal model of allergic asthma reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and
TNF-α levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, indicating that the
antiinflammatory effects of baicalin in vivo are attributable, in part, to its
ability to inhibit PDE4.

The gene and protein expression profiles in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)
may reveal gene and protein markers of a potential clinical relevance in
diagnosis, treatment and prediction of response to therapy. Using cDNA microarray
analysis of 25,100 unique genes, we studied the gene expression profile of CD34+ 
cells and granulocytes obtained from peripheral blood of subjects with essential 
thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The
microarray analyses of the CD34+ cells and granulocytes were performed from 20 de
novo MPN subjects: JAK2 positive ET, PV, PMF subjects, and JAK2 negative ET/PMF
subjects. The granulocytes for proteomic studies were pooled in 4 groups: PV with
JAK2 mutant allele burden above 80%, ET with JAK2 mutation, PMF with JAK2
mutation and ET/PMF with no JAK2 mutation. The number of differentially regulated
genes was about two fold larger in CD34+ cells compared to granulocytes.
Thirty-six genes (including RUNX1, TNFRSF19) were persistently highly expressed, 
while 42 genes (including FOXD4, PDE4A) were underexpressed both in CD34+ cells
and granulocytes. Using proteomic studies, significant up-regulation was observed
for MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling regulators that control myeloid cell apoptosis
and proliferation: RAC2, MNDA, S100A8/9, CORO1A, and GNAI2. When the status of
the mTOR signaling pathway related genes was analyzed, PI3K/AKT regulators were
preferentially up-regulated in CD34+ cells of MPNs, with down-regulated major
components of the protein complex EIF4F. Molecular profiling of CD34+ cells and
granulocytes of MPN determined gene expression patterns beyond their recognized
function in disease pathogenesis that included dominant up-regulation of PI3K/AKT
signaling.

Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) has four isoforms (PDE4A-D) with at least 25 splice
variants. PDE4 subtype nonselective inhibitors produce potent antidepressant-like
and cognition-enhancing effects via increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP)
signaling in the brain. Our previous data have demonstrated that long-form PDE4Ds
appear to be involved in these pharmacological properties of PDE4 inhibitors in
the normal animals. However, it is not clear whether long-form PDE4Ds are
critical for the behaviors and related cellular signaling/neuronal
plasticity/neuroendocrine alterations in the depressed animals. In the present
study, animals exposed to the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a rodent model 
of depression, exhibited elevated corticosterone, depressive-like behavior,
memory deficits, accompanied with decreased cAMP-PKA-CREB and cAMP-ERK1/2-CREB
signaling and neuroplasticity. These alterations induced by CUS were reversed by 
RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated prefrontal cortex long-form PDE4Ds (especially
PDE4D4 and PDE4D5) knock-down, similar to the effects of the PDE4 subtype
nonselective inhibitor rolipram. Furthermore, these effects of RNAi were not
enhanced by rolipram. These data indicate a predominant role of long-form PDE4Ds 
in the pharmacotherapies of PDE4 inhibitors for depression and concomitant memory
deficits. Long-form PDE4Ds, especially PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, appear to be the
promising targets for the development of antidepressants with high therapeutic
indices.

Yessotoxin (YTX) modulates cellular phosphodiesterases (PDEs). In this regard,
opposite effects had been described in the tumor model K-562 cell line and fresh 
human lymphocytes in terms of cell viability, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-cyclic
monophosphate (cAMP) production and protein expression after YTX treatment.
Studies in depth of the pathways activated by YTX in K-562 cell line, have
demonstrated the activation of two different cell death types, apoptosis, and
autophagy after 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively. Furthermore, the key role
of type 4A PDE (PDE4A) in both pathways activated by YTX was demonstrated.
Therefore, taking into account the differences between cellular lines and fresh
cells, a study of cell death pathways activated by YTX in a non-tumor cell line
with mitotic activity, was performed. The cellular model used was the
lymphoblastoid cell line that represents a non-tumor model with normal apoptotic 
and mitotic machinery. In this context, cell viability and cell proliferation,
expression of proteins involved in cell death activated by YTX and mitochondrial 
mass, were studied after the incubation with the toxin. Opposite to the tumor
model, no cell death activation was observed in lymphoblastoid cell line in the
presence of YTX. In this sense, variations in apoptosis hallmarks were not
detected in the lymphoblastoid cell line after YTX incubation, whereas this type 
I of programmed cell death was observed in K-562 cells. On the other hand,
autophagy cell death was triggered in this cellular line, while other autophagic 
process is suggested in lymphoblastoid cells. These YTX effects are related to
PDE4A in both cellular lines. In addition, while cell death is triggered in K-562
cells after YTX treatment, in lymphoblastoid cells the toxin stops cellular
proliferation. These results point to YTX as a specific toxic compound of tumor
cells, since in the non-tumor lymphoblastoid cell line, no cell death hallmarks
are observed.

Protein Kinase C (PKC) is a group of enzymes involved in pro-survival or
pro-apoptotic events depending on the cellular model. Moreover, Yessotoxin (YTX) 
modulates its expression and activates different cell death pathways. In K-562
tumor cell line, YTX induces apoptosis and autophagy after 24 and 48 h of
incubation, respectively, and the toxin carries out its action through the
phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A). Therefore, the levels of two subtypes of PKC,
conventional (cPKC) and δ isotype of novel PKC (PKCδ) were studied at these times
after YTX incubation. Also their involvement in the cell death activated by the
toxin and their relationship with PDE4A was checked. The expression of cPKC and
PKCδ in cytosol, plasma membrane and nucleus was studied in normal and
PDE4A-silenced cells. Furthermore, cell viability of normal cells, as well as
cPKC-, PKCδ- and PDE4A-silenced cells was tested by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)
assay. As a result, PKCδ showed a key role in K-562 cell survive, since without
this protein, K-562 cell decreased their viability. Furthermore, modulation of
PKCs by YTX treatment was observed, however, the changes in the expression of
these proteins are independent of cell death activated by the toxin. In addition,
the modulation of PKCs detected is PDE4A-dependent, since the silencing of this
protein change PKC expression pattern.

Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is an essential contributor to intracellular signaling
and an important drug target. The four members of this enzyme family (PDE4A to
-D) are functional dimers in which each subunit contains two upstream conserved
regions (UCR), UCR1 and -2, which precede the C-terminal catalytic domain.
Alternative promoters, transcriptional start sites, and mRNA splicing lead to the
existence of over 25 variants of PDE4, broadly classified as long, short, and
supershort forms. We report the X-ray crystal structure of long form PDE4B
containing UCR1, UCR2, and the catalytic domain, crystallized as a dimer in which
a disulfide bond cross-links cysteines engineered into UCR2 and the catalytic
domain. Biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses showed that the
UCR2-catalytic domain interaction occurs in trans, and established that this
interaction regulates the catalytic activity of PDE4. By elucidating the key
structural determinants of dimerization, we show that only long forms of PDE4 can
be regulated by this mechanism. The results also provide a structural basis for
the long-standing observation of high- and low-affinity binding sites for the
prototypic inhibitor rolipram.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and distribution of phosphodiesterase
(PDE) isoenzymes PDE1A, PDE2A, PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE5A in human urethral tissue.
METHODS: Specimens of penile urethra were obtained from male subjects who had
undergone male-to-female sex reassignment surgery. Using immunohistochemistry
(immunofluorescence), the occurrence of PDE1A, PDE2A, PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE5A,
the neuronal nitric oxide synthase, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was examined in urethral sections. Cytosolic
supernatants prepared from isolated human urethral tissue were subjected to
Western blot analysis using specific anti-PDE antibodies.
RESULTS: Immunosignals specific for PDE1A, 4A, 4B, and 5A were observed in the
urethral smooth musculature. The smooth muscle bundles were seen innervated by
slender nerve fibers, characterized by the expression of the neuronal nitric
oxide synthase, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide. The expression of the PDE isoenzymes mentioned was confirmed by
Western blotting.
CONCLUSION: The results provide evidence for a significance of both the cyclic
adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling in the
control of human urethral smooth muscle. The selective inhibition of PDE
isoenzymes might represent a pharmacologic option to influence the function of
smooth musculature in the human outflow region.

modulating phosphodiesterase mRNA splicing and degradation.

Glucocorticoid production in the adrenal cortex is activated in response to an
increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling. The nuclear protein p54(nrb)/NONO
belongs to the Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) family and has been
implicated in several nuclear processes, including transcription, splicing, and
RNA export. We previously identified p54(nrb)/NONO as a component of a protein
complex that regulates the transcription of CYP17A1, a gene required for
glucocorticoid production. Based on the multiple mechanisms by which
p54(nrb)/NONO has been shown to control gene expression and the ability of the
protein to be recruited to the CYP17A1 promoter, we sought to further define the 
molecular mechanism by which p54(nrb)/NONO confers optimal cortisol production.
We show here that silencing p54(nrb)/NONO expression in H295R human
adrenocortical cells decreases the ability of the cells to increase intracellular
cAMP production and subsequent cortisol biosynthesis in response to
adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation. Interestingly, the expression of 
multiple phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms, including PDE2A, PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4A, 
PDE4D, and PDE11A, was induced in p54(nrb)/NONO knockdown cells. Investigation of
the mechanism by which silencing of p54(nrb)/NONO led to increased expression of 
select PDE isoforms revealed that p54(nrb)/NONO regulates the splicing of a
subset of PDE isoforms. Importantly, we also identify a role for p54(nrb)/NONO in
regulating the stability of PDE transcripts by facilitating the interaction
between the exoribonuclease XRN2 and select PDE transcripts. In summary, we
report that p54(nrb)/NONO modulates cAMP-dependent signaling, and ultimately
cAMP-stimulated glucocorticoid biosynthesis by regulating the splicing and
degradation of PDE transcripts.

Fifteen cinnoline analogues and six benzimidazole phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) 
inhibitors were synthesized as potential PET radiopharmaceuticals and their in
vitro activity as PDE10A inhibitors was determined. Nine out of twenty-one
compounds were potent inhibitors of PDE10A with IC50 values ranging from 1.5 to
18.6nM. Notably, the IC50 values of compounds 26a, 26b, and 33c were 1.52±0.18,
2.86±0.10, and 3.73±0.60nM, respectively; these three compounds also showed high 
in vitro selectivity (>1000-fold) for PDE10A over PDE 3A/3B, PDE4A/4B. The high
potency and selectivity of these three compounds suggests that they could be
radiolabeled with PET radionuclides for further evaluation of their in vivo
pharmacological behavior and ability to quantify PDE10A in the brain.

RATIONALE: Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) and neuroimmune signaling have been posited
to regulate alcohol drinking.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the involvement of PDE4 and Il22ra2 on ethanol
(EtOH) intake by alcohol-preferring (P) and high-alcohol-drinking (HAD1) rats.
METHODS: Exp 1 determined the dose-response effects of PDE4 inhibitors, rolipram,
and Ro 20-1724, on 2 h/day free-choice EtOH intake by adult P and HAD1 rats. Exps
2-3 examined the effects of repeated administration with the PDE4 inhibitors on
EtOH or sucrose intake and locomotor behavior. Exp 4 determined Pde4-associated
gene expression differences in subregions of the extended amygdala, between high-
and low-alcohol-consuming rat lines. Exp 5 evaluated the effects of infusing
short hairpin RNA to knock down Il22ra2 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell on a
24-h free-choice EtOH drinking by P rats.
RESULTS: Administration of rolipram or Ro 20-1724 reduced EtOH intake by P rats; 
Ro 20-1724 reduced EtOH intake by HAD1 rats. Repeated rolipram or Ro 20-1724
exposure reduced EtOH intake by P and HAD1 rats. PDE4 inhibition induced motor
impairment during the first hour of EtOH intake by P rats. Higher gene expression
levels for PDE4A were found in the NAc shell of P vs NP rats. ShRNAs targeting
Il22ra2 in the NAc shell significantly reduced chronic EtOH intake.
CONCLUSIONS: PDE4 and neuroinflammatory/immune signaling pathways could represent
molecular targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorders in genetically
predisposed subjects. This study underscores the importance of testing compounds 
over multiple days and rat lines when determining efficacy to disrupt excessive
alcohol intake.

Understanding the mechanism of action of the yessotoxin (YTX) is crucial since
this drug has potential pharmacological effects in allergic processes, tumor
proliferation and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been described that YTX
activates apoptosis after 24h of treatment, while after 48 h of incubation with
the toxin a decrease in cell viability corresponding to cellular differentiation 
or non-apoptotic cell death was observed. In this paper, these processes were
extensively studied by using the erythroleukemia K-562 cell line. On one hand,
events of K-562 cell differentiation into erythrocytes after YTX treatment were
studied using hemin as positive control of cell differentiation. Cell
differentiation was studied through the cyclic nucleotide response element
binding (phospho-CREB) and the transferrin receptor (TfR) expression. On the
other hand, using rapamycin as positive control, autophagic hallmarks, as
non-apoptotic cell death, were studied after toxin exposure. In this case, the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and light chain 3B (LC3B) levels were
measured to check autophagy activation. The results showed that cell
differentiation was not occurring after 48 h of toxin incubation while at this
time the autophagy was triggered. Furthermore after 24h of toxin treatment none
of these processes were activated. In addition, the role of the type 4A
phosphodiesterase (PDE4A), the intracellular target of YTX, was checked.
PDE4A-silencing experiments showed different regulation steps of PDE4A in the
autophagic processes triggered either by traditional compounds or YTX. In
summary, after 48 h YTX treatment PDE4A-dependent autophagy, as non-apoptotic
programmed cell death, is activated.

Hypertension (HT) is a prevailing risk factor for cognitive impairment, the most 
common cause of vascular dementia; yet, no possible mechanism underlying the
cognitive impairment induced by hypertension has been identified so far.
Inhibition of PDE-4 has been shown to increase phosphorylation of cAMP-response
element binding protein in the hippocampus and enhance the memory performance.
Here, we examined the effects of PDE-4 inhibitors, rolipram and roflumilast, on
the impairment of learning and memory observed in hypertensive rats. We used
2k-1c hypertensive model to induce learning and memory defects. In addition, mRNA
expression of PDE-4 sub-types A-D was also assessed in the hippocampus tissue.
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by tail-cuff method was significantly 
increased in 2k-1c rats when compared to sham operated rats; this effect was
reversed by clonidine, whereas, PDE-4 inhibitors did not. PDE-4 inhibitors
significantly reversed time induced memory deficit in novel object recognition
task (NORT). Further, the retention latency on the second day in the elevated
plus maze model was significantly shortened after repeated administration of
rolipram and roflumilast. Plasma and brain concentrations of rolipram,
roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide were also measured after the NORT and showed 
linear increase in plasma and brain concentrations. The PDE4B and PDE4D gene
expression was significantly enhanced in hypertensive rats compared with sham
operated however PDE4A and PDE4C remained unaltered. Repeated treatment with
PDE-4 inhibitors caused down regulation of PDE4B and PDE4D in hypertensive rats. 
These results suggest that inhibition of PDE-4 ameliorates HT-induced impairment 
of learning and memory functions.

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) molecular pharmacology and Alzheimer's disease.

Between 20% and 25% of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) do not
have amyloid burden as assessed by positron emission tomography imaging. Thus,
there is a need for nonamyloid-directed therapies for AD, especially for those
patients with non-amyloid AD. The family of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) enzymes
are underexploited therapeutic targets for central nervous system indications.
While the PDE4A, B, and D subtypes are expressed in brain, the strict amino acid 
sequence conservation of the active site across the four subtypes of PDE4 has
made it difficult to discover subtype inhibitors. The recent elucidation of the
structure of the PDE4 N- and C-terminal regulatory domains now makes it possible 
to design subtype-selective, negative allosteric modulators (PDE4-NAMs). These
act through closing the N-terminal UCR2 or C-terminal CR3 regulatory domains, and
thereby inhibit the enzyme by blocking access of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) to the active site. PDE4B-NAMs have the potential to reduce 
neuroinflammation by dampening microglia cytokine production triggered by brain
amyloid, while PDE4D-NAMs have potent cognitive benefit by augmenting signaling
through the cAMP/protein kinase A/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
pathway for memory consolidation. The importance of PDE4D for human cognition is 
underscored by the recent discovery of PDE4D mutations in acrodysostosis (ACRDY2:
MIM 600129), an ultra rare disorder associated with intellectual disability.
Thus, the family of PDE4 enzymes provides rich opportunities for the development 
of mechanistically novel drugs to treat neuroinflammation or the cognitive
deficits in AD.

Experimental and clinical studies have suggested a role for phosphodiesterase
(PDE) isoenzymes in the control of the human lower urinary tract. This study
aimed to investigate the expression of PDE isoenzymes and the effects of PDE
inhibitors (PDE-Is) in isolated human urethral smooth muscle (USM). The
expression of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) specifically encoding for PDE
isoenzymes and isoforms (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 5A and 11A) was analyzed
by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using a
tissue bath technique, the effects of vinpocetine (PDE1-I),
erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride (EHNA-HCl=MEP1) (PDE2-I),
rolipram (PDE4-I), sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil (PDE5-Is) (0.01-10µM) on 
the tension of USM induced by norepinephrine were investigated. The production of
cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cyclic AMP) was measured by means of radioimmunoassays. RT-PCR analysis revealed
the expression of PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE4A, PDE4C, PDE4D, PDE5A and PDE11A. The
tension induced by norepinephrine (NE) was reversed by the PDE inhibitors with
the following rank order of efficacy: rolipram (mean: -39%)≥sildenafil
(-35%)>vardenafil (-26%)>tadalafil (-20%)>vinpocetine (-16%)>MEP1 (-2%). The
relaxing effects of the drugs were paralleled by an elevation in tissue levels of
cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. Selective inhibitors of PDE4 and PDE5 can antagonize
the tension induced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation of USM. PDE inhibition might 
represent an interesting option to facilitate the relaxation of the human outflow
region.

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a super family of 11 enzyme families responsible
for the hydrolysis of the intracellular secondary messengers cyclic AMP (cAMP)
and cyclic GMP (cGMP). PDE4, in particular, is highly expressed in brain regions 
involved with regulation of memory, anxiety, and depression, including the
hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. Senescence has been shown to result
in extreme dysregulation of the cAMP pathway in various brain regions. Thus, as a
critical controller of intracellular cAMP levels, PDE4 may be a potential target 
for the treatment of senescence-related cognitive disorders, which could be
pathological and/or non-pathological in origin. While there is great potential in
the development of novel PDE4 inhibitors for treatment of senescent-cognition
impairment, there are also currently many pitfalls that need to be overcome. PDE4
has four subfamilies (PDE4A, B, C, and D) that are differentially expressed
throughout the brain and body, as well as at least 25 splice variants derived
from alternative splicing and multiple promoter sites. PDE4 subtypes have been
shown to have differential effects on behavior, and cAMP itself has also been
shown to play a contrasting role in behavior in different brain regions. This
review will focus on what is currently understood about PDE4 in aging, the
potential for PDE4 modulation as a cognitive therapy, and current pitfalls and
limitations that need to be overcome in the PDE4 field. Overall, furthering our
understanding of this incredibly complex pathway may one day assist with the
development of novel therapeutics for both pathological and non-pathological
cognitive disorders associated with senescence.

This paper indicated that inactivated Bordetella pertussis (iBp) can enhance the 
lung airway hyperreactivity of the rats sensitized and challenged with OVA. The
mechanisms were involved in the upregulation of cAMP-PDE activity and PDE4A,
PDE4D, and PDE3 gene expression in the lungs. But only PDE4 activity was
different between the OVA and OVA+iBp groups, and PDE4D expression was
significantly increased in iBp rats alone. So, our data suggested that
cosensitization with OVA and iBp affects lung airway reactivity by modulating the
lung cAMP-PDE activity and PDE4D gene expression.

Acrodysostosis without hormone resistance is a rare skeletal disorder
characterized by brachydactyly, nasal hypoplasia, mental retardation and
occasionally developmental delay. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the
gene encoding cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D) have been reported to
cause this rare condition but the pathomechanism has not been fully elucidated.
To understand the pathogenetic mechanism of PDE4D mutations, we conducted 3D
modeling studies to predict changes in the binding efficacy of cAMP to the
catalytic pocket in PDE4D mutants. Our results indicated diminished enzyme
activity in the two mutants we analyzed (Gly673Asp and Ile678Thr; based on PDE4D4
residue numbering). Ectopic expression of PDE4D mutants in HEK293 cells
demonstrated this reduction in activity, which was identified by increased cAMP
levels. However, the cells from an acrodysostosis patient showed low cAMP
accumulation, which resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylated cAMP Response
Element-Binding Protein (pCREB)/CREB ratio. The reason for this discrepancy was
due to a compensatory increase in expression levels of PDE4A and PDE4B isoforms, 
which accounted for the paradoxical decrease in cAMP levels in the patient cells 
expressing mutant isoforms with a lowered PDE4D activity. Skeletal radiographs of
10-week-old knockout (KO) rats showed that the distal part of the forelimb was
shorter than in wild-type (WT) rats and that all the metacarpals and phalanges
were also shorter in KO, as the name acrodysostosis implies. Like the G-protein
α-stimulatory subunit and PRKAR1A, PDE4D critically regulates the cAMP signal
transduction pathway and influences bone formation in a way that
activity-compromising PDE4D mutations can result in skeletal dysplasia. We
propose that specific inhibitory PDE4D mutations can lead to the molecular
pathology of acrodysostosis without hormone resistance but that the pathological 
phenotype may well be dependent on an over-compensatory induction of other PDE4
isoforms that can be expected to be targeted to different signaling complexes and
exert distinct effects on compartmentalized cAMP signaling.

Here, we chronologically analyzed age-associated changes of cAMP- and
MAPK-signaling in Leydig cells (LCs) in relation with decreased testosterone (T) 
production. In Wistar rats, decreased serum T observed in 12 to 24-month-old rats
was not related to decreased serum LH concentration but to reduced luteinizing
hormone receptor (Lhr/LHR) and time-coordinated reduction of steroidogenic gene
expression (decreased Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1 in 12-month-old rats followed by decreased
Star/StAR, Hsd3b/HSD3B, Hsd17b4, and increased Cyp19a1 later in life). The
predecessors of age-related changes noted in LCs from 6 to 12-month-old rats were
increased level of soluble adenylate cyclase (Adcy/AC) 10, increased JNK
phosphorylation but suppressed P38 MAPK. At approximately the same time changed
mRNA abundance for transcription factors important for steroidogenesis was
detected (increased Nur77 and decreased Sf1, Dax1). Aging caused biphasic
expression pattern of ERK1/2 and Nur77: increased in 12-month but decreased in
LCs from 24-month-old rats. Further, decreased basal cAMP level observed from 12 
to 24th month coincidence with increased expression of cAMP-specific
phosphodiesterase (Pde)4a, Pde4b and regulatory subunit of protein kinase A
(Prkar/PKAR). Exposing of senescent LCs to permeable cAMP-analog improved
transcription of Sf1, Nur77, Star, Cyp11a1,Cyp17a1, but without effect on aging
pattern of Dax1, Pde4a/b, Prkar2a, Lhr and MAPK genes. Collectively, results
indicated that age-related LC dysfunction is accompanied with changes in MAPK and
cAMP signaling and coordinated reduction in the expression of many of the genes
that participate in T synthesis. The predecessors of aged-related changes are
increased ratio of pJNK/JNK, AC10 and decreased P38 level in LCs from 6-month-old
rats.

The cellular localization of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), protein kinase 
A (PKAs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is a key step to the spatiotemporal
regulation of the second messenger adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP).
In this paper the cellular distribution of the mitochondrial AKAP 149-PKA-PDE4A
complex and its implications in the cell death induced by YTX treatment, a known 
PDE modulator, was studied. K-562 cell line was incubated with YTX for 24 or 48
h. Under these conditions AKAP 149, PKA and type-4A PDE (PDE4A) levels were
measured in the cytosol, in the plasma membrane and in the nucleus. Apoptotic
hallmarks were also measured after the same conditions. In addition, YTX effect
on cell viability was checked after AKAP 149 and PDE4A silencing. The results
obtained show a decrease in AKAP 149-PKA-PDE4A levels in cytosol after YTX
exposure. 24h after the toxin addition, the complex expression increased in the
plasma membrane and after 48 h in the nucleus domain. Furthermore Bcl-2 levels
were decreased and the expression of caspase 3 together with caspase 8 activity
were increased after 24h of toxin incubation but not after 48 h. These results
suggest apoptotic cell death at 24h and a non-apoptotic cell death after 48 h.
When AKAP 149 and PDE4A were silenced YTX did not induce cellular death. In
summary, AKAP 149-PKA-PDE4A complex localization is related with YTX effect in
K-562 cell line. When this complex is mainly located in the plasma membrane
apoptosis is activated while when the complex is in the nuclear domain
non-apoptotic cellular death or cellular differentiation is activated. Therefore 
AKAP 149-PKA-PDE4A distribution and integrity have a key role in cellular
survival.

association cortex.

The pattern of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is very distinctive:
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau selectively
affect pyramidal neurons of the aging association cortex that interconnect
extensively through glutamate synapses on dendritic spines. In contrast, primary 
sensory cortices have few NFTs, even in late-stage disease. Understanding this
selective vulnerability, and why advancing age is such a high risk factor for the
degenerative process, may help to reveal disease etiology and provide targets for
intervention. Our study has revealed age-related increase in cAMP-dependent
protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation of tau at serine 214 (pS214-tau) in monkey
dorsolateral prefrontal association cortex (dlPFC), which specifically targets
spine synapses and the Ca(2+)-storing spine apparatus. This increase is mirrored 
by loss of phosphodiesterase 4A from the spine apparatus, consistent with
increase in cAMP-Ca(2+) signaling in aging spines. Phosphorylated tau was not
detected in primary visual cortex, similar to the pattern observed in AD. We also
report electron microscopic evidence of previously unidentified vesicular
trafficking of phosphorylated tau in normal association cortex--in axons in young
dlPFC vs. in spines in aged dlPFC--consistent with the transneuronal lesion
spread reported in genetic rodent models. pS214-Tau was not observed in normal
aged mice, suggesting that it arises with the evolutionary expansion of
corticocortical connections in primates, crossing the threshold into NFTs and
degeneration in humans. Thus, the cAMP-Ca(2+) signaling mechanisms, needed for
flexibly modulating network strength in young association cortex, confer
vulnerability to degeneration when dysregulated with advancing age.

Vaso-occlusive crises are the main acute complication in sickle cell disease.
They are initiated by abnormal adhesion of circulating blood cells to vascular
endothelium of the microcirculation. Several interactions involving an intricate 
network of adhesion molecules have been described between sickle red blood cells 
and the endothelial vascular wall. We have shown previously that young sickle
reticulocytes adhere to resting endothelial cells through the interaction of α4β1
integrin with endothelial Lutheran/basal cell adhesion molecule (Lu/BCAM). In the
present work, we investigated the functional impact of endothelial exposure to
hydroxycarbamide (HC) on this interaction using transformed human bone marrow
endothelial cells and primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.
Adhesion of sickle reticulocytes to HC-treated endothelial cells was decreased
despite the HC-derived increase of Lu/BCAM expression. This was associated with
decreased phosphorylation of Lu/BCAM and up-regulation of the cAMP-specific
phosphodiesterase 4A expression. Our study reveals a novel mechanism for HC in
endothelial cells where it could modulate the function of membrane proteins
through the regulation of phosphodiesterase expression and cAMP-dependent
signaling pathways.

RATIONALE: Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a super family of enzymes responsible
for the halting of intracellular cyclic nucleotide signaling and may represent
novel therapeutic targets for treatment of cognitive disorders. PDE4 is of
considerable interest to cognitive research because it is highly expressed in the
brain, particularly in the cognition-related brain regions. Recently, the
functional role of PDE4B and PDE4D, two of the four PDE4 subtypes (PDE4A, B, C,
and D), in behavior has begun to be identified; however, the role of PDE4A in the
regulation of behavior is still unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize the functional role of 
PDE4A in behavior.
METHODS: The role of PDE4A in behavior was evaluated through a battery of
behavioral tests using PDE4A knockout (KO) mice; urine corticosterone levels were
also measured.
RESULTS: PDE4A KO mice exhibited improved memory in the
step-through-passive-avoidance test. They also displayed anxiogenic-like behavior
in elevated-plus maze, holeboard, light-dark transition, and novelty suppressed
feeding tests. Consistent with the anxiety profile, PDE4A KO mice had elevated
corticosterone levels compared with wild-type controls post-stress.
Interestingly, PDE4A KO mice displayed no change in object recognition, Morris
water maze, forced swim, tail suspension, and duration of anesthesia induced by
co-administration of xylazine and ketamine (suggesting that PDE4A KO may not be
emetic).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PDE4A may be important in the regulation 
of emotional memory and anxiety-like behavior, but not emesis. PDE4A could
possibly represent a novel therapeutic target in the future for anxiety or
disorders affecting memory.

Increasing evidence has indicated that immune challenge by bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces depressive-like behavior, neuroinflammatory
response and upregulates phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), an enzyme that specifically 
hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, whether the potential 
PDE4 inhibitor etazolate prevents the LPS-induced depressive-like behavior
remains unclear. Here using a model of depression induced by the repeated
administration of LPS during 16days, and then investigated the influence of LPS
on the expression of PDE4, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and antidepressant action of
etazolate in mice through forced swimming, novelty suppressed feeding, sucrose
preference and open-field tests. Our results showed that etazolate pretreatment
facilitated the recovery from weight loss and prevented the depressive-like
behavior induced by repeated LPS administration. Moreover, the antidepressant
action of etazolate was paralleled by significantly reducing the expression
levels of PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4D and IL-1β and up-regulating the cAMP/phosphorylated
cAMP response-element binding protein (pCREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) signaling in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. These results 
indicate that the effects of etazolate on the depressive-like behavior induced by
repeated LPS treatment may partially depend on the inhibition of PDE4 subtypes,
the activation of the cAMP/pCREB/BDNF signaling and the anti-inflammatory
responses in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

Phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B) regulates the pro-inflammatory Toll Receptor -Tumor 
Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) pathway in monocytes, macrophages and microglial cells. 
As such, it is an important, although under-exploited molecular target for
anti-inflammatory drugs. This is due in part to the difficulty of developing
selective PDE4B inhibitors as the amino acid sequence of the PDE4 active site is 
identical in all PDE4 subtypes (PDE4A-D). We show that highly selective PDE4B
inhibitors can be designed by exploiting sequence differences outside the active 
site. Specifically, PDE4B selectivity can be achieved by capture of a C-terminal 
regulatory helix, now termed CR3 (Control Region 3), across the active site in a 
conformation that closes access by cAMP. PDE4B selectivity is driven by a single 
amino acid polymorphism in CR3 (Leu674 in PDE4B1 versus Gln594 in PDE4D). The
reciprocal mutations in PDE4B and PDE4D cause a 70-80 fold shift in selectivity. 
Our structural studies show that CR3 is flexible and can adopt multiple
orientations and multiple registries in the closed conformation. The new
co-crystal structure with bound ligand provides a guide map for the design of
PDE4B selective anti-inflammatory drugs.

PGE 2 desensitizes β -agonist effect on human lung fibroblast-mediated collagen
gel contraction through upregulating PDE4.

Medical University, Beijing 100038, China ; Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep and
Allergy Division, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical
Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5910, USA.

In the current study, we investigated the effect of a long-acting β -agonist
(salmeterol) and a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor (cilomilast) on human
lung fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction. Higher concentrations of
salmeterol (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) inhibited fibroblast-mediated collagen gel
contraction. No effect was observed with cilomilast alone (up to 10(-5) M). In
the presence of 10(-8) M salmeterol, however, cilomilast could significantly
inhibit fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction in a concentration-dependent
manner (10(-7) ~10(-5) M). Blockade of endogenous PGE2 by indomethacin further
potentiated the inhibitory effect of salmeterol on fibroblast-mediated collagen
gel contraction, but it did not affect cilomilast's effect. Pretreatment with
PGE2 abolished the inhibitory effect of salmeterol, but it potentiated the
inhibitory effect of cilomilast on fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction. 
Finally, indomethacin slightly inhibited PDE4C expression, while PGE2 stimulated 
the expression of PDE4A and -4C in human lung fibroblasts. These findings suggest
that long-acting β -agonist and PDE4 inhibitor have a synergistic effect in
regulating fibroblast tissue repair functions and that PGE2 can modulate the
effect of β -agonist and PDE4 inhibitor at least in part through the mechanism of
regulating PDE4 expression.

3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are the only known enzymes to
compartmentalize cAMP and cGMP, yet little is known about how PDEs are
dynamically regulated across the lifespan. We mapped mRNA expression of all 21
PDE isoforms in the adult rat and mouse central nervous system (CNS) using
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and in situ hybridization to assess
conservation across species. We also compared PDE mRNA and protein in the brains 
of old (26 months) versus young (5 months) Sprague-Dawley rats, with select
experiments replicated in old (9 months) versus young (2 months) BALB/cJ mice. We
show that each PDE isoform exhibits a unique expression pattern across the brain 
that is highly conserved between rats, mice, and humans. PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE2A,
PDE4A, PDE4D, PDE5A, PDE7A, PDE8A, PDE8B, PDE10A, and PDE11A showed an
age-related increase or decrease in mRNA expression in at least 1 of the 4 brain 
regions examined (hippocampus, cortex, striatum, and cerebellum). In contrast,
mRNA expression of PDE1A, PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4B, PDE7A, PDE7B, and PDE9A did not
change with age. Age-related increases in PDE11A4, PDE8A3, PDE8A4/5, and PDE1C1
protein expression were confirmed in hippocampus of old versus young rodents, as 
were age-related increases in PDE8A3 protein expression in the striatum.
Age-related changes in PDE expression appear to have functional consequences as, 
relative to young rats, the hippocampi of old rats demonstrated strikingly
decreased phosphorylation of GluR1, CaMKIIα, and CaMKIIβ, decreased expression of
the transmembrane AMPA regulatory proteins γ2 (a.k.a. stargazin) and γ8, and
increased trimethylation of H3K27. Interestingly, expression of PDE11A4,
PDE8A4/5, PDE8A3, and PDE1C1 correlate with these functional endpoints in young
but not old rats, suggesting that aging is not only associated with a change in
PDE expression but also a change in PDE compartmentalization.

Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of the broad spectrum
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor pentoxifylline have suggested an important role
for cyclic nucleotides in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis; however, studies 
examining the role of specific PDEs are lacking. Endotoxemia and Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammatory and profibrotic signaling play a major
role in the development of hepatic fibrosis. Because cAMP-specific PDE4
critically regulates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-TLR4-induced inflammatory cytokine 
expression, its pathogenic role in bile duct ligation-induced hepatic injury and 
fibrogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats was examined. Initiation of cholestatic liver
injury and fibrosis was accompanied by a significant induction of PDE4A, B, and D
expression and activity. Treatment with the PDE4-specific inhibitor rolipram
significantly decreased liver PDE4 activity, hepatic inflammatory and profibrotic
cytokine expression, injury, and fibrosis. At the cellular level, in relevance to
endotoxemia and inflammatory cytokine production, PDE4B was observed to play a
major regulatory role in the LPS-inducible tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production
by isolated Kupffer cells. Moreover, PDE4 expression was also involved in the in 
vitro activation and transdifferentiation of isolated hepatic stellate cells
(HSCs). Particularly, PDE4A, B, and D upregulation preceded induction of the HSC 
activation marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). In vitro treatment of HSCs with 
rolipram effectively attenuated α-SMA, collagen expression, and accompanying
morphologic changes. Overall, these data strongly suggest that upregulation of
PDE4 expression during cholestatic liver injury plays a potential pathogenic role
in the development of inflammation, injury, and fibrosis.

INTRODUCTION: The second messengers cAMP and cGMP mediate fundamental aspects of 
brain function relevant to memory, learning, and cognitive functions.
Consequently, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), the enzymes that
inactivate the cyclic nucleotides, are promising targets for the development of
cognition-enhancing drugs.
AREAS COVERED: PDE4 is the largest of the 11 mammalian PDE families. This review 
covers the properties and functions of the PDE4 family, highlighting procognitive
and memory-enhancing effects associated with their inactivation.
EXPERT OPINION: PAN-selective PDE4 inhibitors exert a number of memory- and
cognition-enhancing effects and have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative
properties in preclinical models. The major hurdle for their clinical application
is to target inhibitors to specific PDE4 isoforms relevant to particular
cognitive disorders to realize the therapeutic potential while avoiding side
effects, in particular emesis and nausea. The PDE4 family comprises four genes,
PDE4A-D, each expressed as multiple variants. Progress to date stems from
characterization of rodent models with selective ablation of individual PDE4
subtypes, revealing that individual subtypes exert unique and non-redundant
functions in the brain. Thus, targeting specific PDE4 subtypes, as well as
splicing variants or conformational states, represents a promising strategy to
separate the therapeutic benefits from the side effects of PAN-PDE4 inhibitors.

Twenty eight new analogues were synthesized by optimizing the structure of MP-10 
and their in vitro binding affinities towards PDE10A, PDE3A/B, and PDE4A/B were
determined. Among these new analogues, 10a, 10b, 10d, 11a, 11b and 11d are very
potent towards PDE10A and have IC50 values of 0.40 ± 0.02, 0.28 ± 0.06, 1.82 ±
0.25, 0.24 ± 0.05, 0.36 ± 0.03 and 1.78 ± 0.03 nM respectively; these six
compounds displayed high selectivity for PDE10A versus PDE3A/3B/4A/4B. The
promising compounds will be further validated in vivo to identify PDE10A imaging 
tracers.

Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) concerns the screening of low-molecular
weight compounds against macromolecular targets of clinical relevance. These
compounds act as starting points for the development of drugs. FBDD has evolved
and grown in popularity over the past 15 years. In this paper, the rationale and 
technology behind the use of X-ray crystallography in fragment based screening
(FBS) will be described, including fragment library design and use of synchrotron
radiation and robotics for high-throughput X-ray data collection. Some recent
uses of crystallography in FBS will be described in detail, including
interrogation of the drug targets β-secretase, phenylethanolamine
N-methyltransferase, phosphodiesterase 4A and Hsp90. These examples provide
illustrations of projects where crystallography is straightforward or difficult, 
and where other screening methods can help overcome the limitations of
crystallography necessitated by diffraction quality.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in significant inflammation which
contributes to the evolving pathology. Previously, we have demonstrated that
cyclic AMP (cAMP), a molecule involved in inflammation, is down-regulated after
TBI. To determine the mechanism by which cAMP is down-regulated after TBI, we
determined whether TBI induces changes in phosphodiesterase (PDE) expression.
Adult male Sprague Dawley rats received moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion
brain injury (FPI) or sham injury, and the ipsilateral, parietal cortex was
analyzed by western blotting. In the ipsilateral parietal cortex, expression of
PDE1A, PDE4B2, and PDE4D2, significantly increased from 30 min to 24 h
post-injury. PDE10A significantly increased at 6 and 24 h after TBI.
Phosphorylation of PDE4A significantly increased from 6 h to 7 days post-injury. 
In contrast, PDE1B, PD4A5, and PDE4A8 significantly decreased after TBI. No
changes were observed with PDE1C, PDE3A, PDE4B1/3, PDE4B4, PDE4D3, PDE4D4, PDE8A,
or PDE8B. Co-localization studies showed that PDE1A, PDE4B2, and phospho-PDE4A
were neuronally expressed, whereas PDE4D2 was expressed in neither neurons nor
glia. These findings suggest that therapies to reduce inflammation after TBI
could be facilitated with targeted therapies, in particular for PDE1A, PDE4B2,
PDE4D2, or PDE10A.

chronic eosinophilic airway inflammation.

We investigated and compared the pharmacological effects of a PDE4 inhibitor
ASP3258
(3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-ethyl-7-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-3-yl] 
propanoic acid), with those of roflumilast, the most clinically advanced PDE4
inhibitor known. ASP3258 inhibited human PDE4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D with respective
IC(50) values of 0.036, 0.050, 0.45, and 0.035 nmol/l, all approximately 3-6
times more potent than roflumilast. ASP3258 inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α
production and PHA-induced IL-5 production in human whole blood cells with
respective IC(50) values of 110 and 100 nmol/l, both approximately 10 times less 
potent than roflumilast. Repeatedly administered ASP3258 and roflumilast both
suppressed chronic airway eosinophilia induced by repeated exposure to ovalbumin 
in Brown Norway rats with respective ED(50) values of 0.092 and 0.17 mg/kg. We
also evaluated the toxicological profiles of ASP3258. Although PDE4 inhibitors
induce emesis by mimicking the pharmacological action of an α(2)-adrenoceptor
antagonist, repeated administration of ASP3258 (3 mg/kg) had no such inhibitory
effect on rats anesthetized with α(2) - adrenoceptor agonist. PDE4 inhibitors are
also known to induce vascular injury in rats. Although repeatedly administered
ASP3258 (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly increased plasma fibrinogen, a biomarker
for toxicity, 1 mg/kg of ASP3258 did not. These results suggest that ASP3258 is
an attractive PDE4 inhibitor for treating chronic eosinophilic airway
inflammation due to asthma.

The extent of damage following spinal cord injury (SCI) can be reduced by various
neuroprotective regimens that include maintaining levels of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cyclic AMP), via administration of the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) 
inhibitor Rolipram. The current study sought to determine the optimal
neuroprotective dose, route and therapeutic window for Rolipram following
contusive SCI in rat as well as its prominent PDE target and putative mechanism
of protection. Rolipram or vehicle control (10% ethanol) was given subcutaneously
(s.c.) daily for 2 wk post-injury (PI) after which the preservation of
oligodendrocytes, neurons and central myelinated axons was stereologically
assessed. Doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg (given at 1 h PI) increased neuronal
survival; 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg/kg protected oligodendrocytes and 1.0 mg/kg produced
optimal preservation of central myelinated axons. Ethanol also demonstrated
significant neuronal and oligo-protection; though the preservation provided was
significantly less than Rolipram. Subsequent use of this optimal Rolipram dose,
1.0 mg/kg, via different routes (i.v., s.c. or oral, 1 h PI), demonstrated that
i.v. administration produced the most significant and consistent cyto- and axo-
protection, although all routes were effective. Examination of the therapeutic
window for i.v. Rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), when initiated between 1 and 48 h after
SCI, revealed maximal neuroprotection at 2 h post-SCI, although the protective
efficacy of Rolipram could still be observed when administration was delayed for 
up to 48 h PI. Importantly, use of the optimal Rolipram regimen significantly
improved locomotor function after SCI as measured by the BBB score. Lastly we
show SCI-induced changes in PDE4A, B and D expression and phosphorylation as well
as cytokine expression and immune cell infiltration. We demonstrate that Rolipram
abrogates SCI-induced PDE4B1 and PDE4A5 production, PDE4A5 phosphorylation, MCP-1
expression and immune cell infiltration, while preventing post-injury reductions 
in IL-10. This work supports the use of Rolipram as an acute neuroprotectant
following SCI and defines an optimal administration protocol and target for its
therapeutic application.

BACKGROUND: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) signaling engaged by β-adrenergic
receptors is pivotal in the regulation of myocardial contractility and
remodeling. However, the role of PI3Kγ in catecholamine-induced arrhythmia is
currently unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice lacking PI3Kγ (PI3Kγ(-/-)) showed runs of premature
ventricular contractions on adrenergic stimulation that could be rescued by a
selective β(2)-adrenergic receptor blocker and developed sustained ventricular
tachycardia after transverse aortic constriction. Consistently, fluorescence
resonance energy transfer probes revealed abnormal cAMP accumulation after
β(2)-adrenergic receptor activation in PI3Kγ(-/-) cardiomyocytes that depended on
the loss of the scaffold but not of the catalytic activity of PI3Kγ. Downstream
from β-adrenergic receptors, PI3Kγ was found to participate in multiprotein
complexes linking protein kinase A to the activation of phosphodiesterase (PDE)
3A, PDE4A, and PDE4B but not of PDE4D. These PI3Kγ-regulated PDEs lowered cAMP
and limited protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of L-type calcium channel
(Ca(v)1.2) and phospholamban. In PI3Kγ(-/-) cardiomyocytes, Ca(v)1.2 and
phospholamban were hyperphosphorylated, leading to increased Ca(2+) spark
occurrence and amplitude on adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, PI3Kγ(-/-)
cardiomyocytes showed spontaneous Ca(2+) release events and developed arrhythmic 
calcium transients.
CONCLUSIONS: PI3Kγ coordinates the coincident signaling of the major cardiac PDE3
and PDE4 isoforms, thus orchestrating a feedback loop that prevents
calcium-dependent ventricular arrhythmia.

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are important regulators of signal transduction
processes. Eleven PDE gene families (PDE1-11) have been identified and several
PDE isoforms are selectively expressed in various cell types. PDE4 family members
specifically hydrolyze cyclic AMP (cAMP). Four genes (PDE4A-D) are known to
encode PDE4 enzymes, with additional diversity generated by the use of
alternative mRNA splicing and the use of different promoters. While PDE4
selective inhibitors show therapeutic potential for treating major diseases such 
as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, little is known concerning
the role of PDE4 in malignant melanoma. In this study, we examined the role of
PDE4 in mouse B16-F10 melanoma cells. In these cells, PDE4 activity was found to 
be ∼60% of total PDE activity. RT-PCR detected only PDE4B and PDE4D mRNA. Cell
growth was inhibited by the cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP, but not by the specific
PDE4 inhibitors, rolipram and denbufylline, which increased intracellular cAMP
concentrations. Finally, migration of the B16-F10 cells was inhibited by the PDE4
inhibitors and 8-bromo-cAMP, while migration was increased by a protein kinase A 
(PKA) inhibitor, PKI(14-22), and was not affected by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP, which
is an analog of exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). The inhibitory effect 
of rolipram on migration was reversed by PKI(14-22). Based on these results, PDE4
appears to play an important role in the migration of B16-F10 cells, and
therefore may be a novel target for the treatment of malignant melanoma.

Isolation and characterization of smooth muscle cells from rat corpus cavernosum 
tissue for the study of erectile dysfunction.

PURPOSE: Primary culture of the cavernous smooth muscle cells from corpus
cavernous tissues is known to be difficult, mainly because of contamination with 
fibroblasts. We applied a new method for better isolation of rat penile smooth
muscle cells (RPSMCs) from rat corpus cavernosum tissue for reliable ex vivo
research on erectile dysfunction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With the use of 8-week-old adult male Sprague-Dawley rats,
ex vivo migrations of rat cavernous tissue were measured by penis and aortic ring
assay by use of a Matrigel-based D-valine-modified culture method. The expression
of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 
(PECAM)-1 in the RPSMCs was determined by standard immunofluorescent staining and
immunoblotting. The expression patterns of phosphodiesterase (PDE) family mRNA in
RPSMCs were compared with patterns in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) by 
use of quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Immunocytochemical staining showed greater α-SMA-positive and
PCAM-1-negative fluorescence. Moreover, whereas the expression of α-SMA was
detected in the RPSMCs, that of PECAM-1 was not. The levels of PDE1A, PDE1B,
PDE1C, PDE2A, PDE3A, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE4D, and PDE5A mRNA in the RPSMCs
were about 3.2-, 4.4-, 3.4-, 29.0-, 3.5-, 2.8-, 2.9-, 6.1-, 45.0-, and 6.0-fold
the corresponding expression in RASMCs.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a two-stage tissue culture method utilizing a
Matrigel-based sprouting culture system to facilitate stromal cell sprouting and 
an adherent culture system using D-valine to eliminate the contamination of
fibroblasts into the smooth muscle cells.

(SISSA), and Italian Institute of Technology, SISSA Unit, Trieste, Italy.

The rodent vomeronasal organ plays an important role in many social behaviors.
Using the calcium imaging technique with the dye fluo-4 we measured intracellular
calcium concentration changes induced by the application of sulfated steroids to 
neurons isolated from the vomeronasal organ of female mice. We found that a mix
of 10 sulfated steroids from the androgen, estrogen, pregnanolone, and
glucocorticoid families induced a calcium response in 71% of neurons. Moreover,
31% of the neurons responded to a mix composed of 3 glucocorticoid-derived
compounds, and 28% responded to a mix composed of 3 pregnanolone-derived
compounds. Immunohistochemistry showed that neurons responding to sulfated
steroids expressed phosphodiesterase 4A, a marker specific for apical neurons
expressing V1R receptors. None of the neuron that responded to 1 mix responded
also to the other, indicating a specificity of the responses. Some neurons
responded to more than 1 individual component of the glucocorticoid-derived mix
tested at high concentration, suggesting that these neurons are broadly tuned,
although they still displayed strong specificity, remaining unresponsive to high 
concentrations of the ineffective compounds.

Sex-related differences of cAMP-specific PDE4B3 mRNA in oligodendrocytes
following systemic inflammation.

Sex-related differences have been observed in the incidence and severity of
several neurological diseases and in sepsis in humans. Cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) has been shown to play an important role in modulating the
inflammatory environment during neuroinflammation and importantly in protecting
myelin from excitotoxic cell death. Considering the sexual dimorphism in the
functional properties of oligodendrocytes and the importance of a systemic
inflammation in the progression of multiple sclerosis, we focused on identifying 
possible sex-related differences in the alterations previously reported for the
two phosphodiesterase4B (PDE4B) splice-variants (PDE4B2 and PDE4B3) mRNA
expression during innate neuroinflammation. PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D are present
in oligodendrocytes and we have previously reported that PDE4B3 mRNA is readily
expressed in both oligodendrocytes and neurons. In this study, we analyzed the
influence of an intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection on the distribution 
pattern and expression levels of the PDE4B mRNA splicing variants in both male
and female mice brains. Clear differences were observed in PDE4B2 and PDE4B3 mRNA
expression levels in males compared with females in a time-dependent manner.
Furthermore, we observed that the clear downregulation of PDE4B3 mRNA was
reflected in a lower percentage of oligodendrocytes positive for this transcript 
which correlated with a decrease in inducible cAMP early repressor expression in 
female corpus callosum.

Phosphodiesterase 4 and its inhibitors in inflammatory diseases.

Taiwan. slcj@ncu.edu.tw

Type 4 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE4) are a family of low km
3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-specific phosphodiesterases including
at least 20 isozymes encoded by four genes (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D) in
mammals. Each PDE4 gene plays a special, nonredundant role in the control of cell
function even though the four subfamilies share the highly conserved catalytic
domain and upstream conserved region (UCR) 1 and UCR2 motifs of the regulatory
domain. By their wide tissue distribution as well as differential expression and 
regulation among various cell types, PDE4s are viewed as critical regulators of
intracellular cAMP levels, cAMP signaling, and signal compartmentalization. By
increasing cAMP levels, PDE4 inhibitors show a broad spectrum of
anti-inflammatory effects in almost all inflammatory cells. Many PDE4 inhibitors 
have been evaluated in clinical trials for various inflammatory conditions.
Developed inhibitors, including the recently approved and marketed roflumilast,
have considerable efficacy, but they also have adverse effects such as nausea and
emesis which limit their dosing and subsequently their immunomodulatory activity.
Thus, the development of PDE4 inhibitors with improved therapeutic indexes has
been a major focus of pharmaceutical research for the treatment of chronic
inflammatory diseases. Recent PDE4 gene knockout studies strongly suggest that
PDE4 inhibitors with PDE4B selectivity may retain the anti-inflammatory effects
while limiting side effects. Development of PDE4 inhibitors with different
delivery routes, such as topical application and inhalation, is also a promising 
approach for the treatment of pulmonary inflammatory conditions and dermatitis.
This review includes a brief overview of the domain structure and function of
PDE4 isozymes, the role of PDE4s in inflammatory cell responses, and the
potential therapeutic utility of PDE4 inhibitors in inflammatory diseases.

Schizophrenia associates with impaired prefrontal cortical (PFC) function and
alterations in cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathways. These include genetic
insults to disrupted-in-schizophrenia (DISC1) and phosphodiesterases (PDE4s)
regulating cAMP hydrolysis, and increased dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) expression
that elevates cAMP. We used immunoelectron microscopy to localize DISC1, PDE4A,
PDE4B, and D1R in monkey PFC and to view spatial interactions with
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels that gate
network inputs when opened by cAMP. Physiological interactions between PDE4s and 
HCN channels were tested in recordings of PFC neurons in monkeys performing a
spatial working memory task. The study reveals a constellation of cAMP-related
proteins (DISC1, PDE4A, and D1R) and HCN channels next to excitatory synapses and
the spine neck in thin spines of superficial PFC, where working memory
microcircuits interconnect and spine loss is most evident in schizophrenia. In
contrast, channels in dendrites were distant from synapses and cAMP-related
proteins, and were associated with endosomal trafficking. The data suggest that a
cAMP signalplex is selectively positioned in the spines to gate PFC pyramidal
cell microcircuits. Single-unit recordings confirmed physiological interactions
between cAMP and HCN channels, consistent with gating actions. These data may
explain why PFC networks are especially vulnerable to genetic insults that
dysregulate cAMP signaling.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent data suggest
that cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are relevant in various cancer
pathologies. Pathophysiological role of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) with possible 
therapeutic prospects in lung cancer was investigated. We exposed 10 different
lung cancer cell lines (adenocarcinoma, squamous and large cell carcinoma) to
hypoxia and assessed expression and activity of PDE4 by real-time PCR,
immunocytochemistry, western blotting and PDE activity assays. Expression and
activity of distinct PDE4 isoforms (PDE4A and PDE4D) increased in response to
hypoxia in eight of the studied cell lines. Furthermore, we analyzed various in
silico predicted hypoxia-responsive elements (p-HREs) found in in PDE4A and PDE4D
genes. Performing mutation analysis of the p-HRE in luciferase reporter
constructs, we identified four functional HRE sites in the PDE4A gene and two
functional HRE sites in the PDE4D gene that mediated hypoxic induction of the
reporter. Silencing of hypoxia-inducible factor subunits (HIF1α and HIF2α) by
small interfering RNA reduced hypoxic induction of PDE4A and PDE4D. Vice versa,
using a PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4i) as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
-elevating agent, cAMP analogs or protein kinase A (PKA)-modulating drugs and an 
exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) activator, we demonstrated
that PDE4-cAMP-PKA/EPAC axis enhanced HIF signaling as measured by HRE reporter
gene assay, HIF and HIF target genes expression ((lactate dehydrogenase A), LDHA,
(pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) PDK1 and (vascular endothelial growth factor A)
VEGFA). Notably, inhibition of PDE4 by PDE4i or silencing of PDE4A and PDE4D
reduced human lung tumor cell proliferation and colony formation. On the other
hand, overexpression of PDE4A or PDE4D increased human lung cancer proliferation.
Moreover, PDE4i treatment reduced hypoxia-induced VEGF secretion in human cells. 
In vivo, PDE4i inhibited tumor xenograft growth in nude mice by attenuating
proliferation and angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that PDE4 is expressed in
lung cancer, crosstalks with HIF signaling and promotes lung cancer progression. 
Thus, PDE4 may represent a therapeutic target for lung cancer therapy.

the expression of cAMP signaling elements and adrenergic receptors in Leydig
cells.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of acute (2 h daily) and repeated 
(2 h daily for 2 or 10 consecutive days) immobilization stress (IMO) on: 1) the
steroidogenic machinery homeostasis; 2) cAMP signaling; and the expression of
receptors for main markers of 3) adrenergic and 4) glucocorticoid signaling in
Leydig cells of adult rats. The results showed that acute IMO inhibited
steroidogenic machinery in Leydig cells by downregulation of Scarb1 (scavenger
receptor class B), Cyp11a1 (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme), Cyp17a1
(17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase), and Hsd17b3 (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)
expression. In addition to acute IMO effects, repeated IMO increased
transcription of Star (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) and Arr19
(androgen receptor corepressor 19 kDa) in Leydig cells. In the same cells, the
transcription of adenylyl cyclases (Adcy7, Adcy9, Adcy10) and cAMP-specific
phosphodiesterases (Pde4a, Pde4b, Pde4d, Pde7a, Pde8a) was stimulated, whereas
the expression of the genes encoding protein kinase A subunits were unaffected.
Ten times repeated IMO increased the levels of all adrenergic receptors and
β-adrenergic receptor kinase (Adrbk1) in Leydig cells. The transcription analysis
was supported by cAMP/testosterone production. In this signaling scenario,
partial recovery of testosterone production in medium/content was detected. The
physiological significance of the present results was proven by ex vivo
application of epinephrine, which increased cAMP/testosterone production by
Leydig cells from control rats in greater fashion than from stressed. IMO did not
affect the expression of transcripts for Crhr1/Crhr2 (corticotropin releasing
hormone receptors), Acthr (adrenocorticotropin releasing hormone receptor), Gr
(glucocorticoid receptor), and Hsd11b1 [hydroxysteroid (11-β) dehydrogenase 1],
while all types of IMO stimulated the expression of Hsd11b2, the unidirectional
oxidase with high affinity to inactivate glucocorticoids. Thus, presented data
provide new molecular/transcriptional base for "fight/adaptation" of Leydig cells
and new insights into the role of cAMP, epinephrine, and glucocorticoid signaling
in recovery of stress-impaired Leydig cell steroidogenesis.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a polymorphic and multigenic inflammatory
autoimmune disease. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) modulates inflammation and the inhibition
of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), which specifically
hydrolyzes cAMP, inhibits TNFα secretion. This study was aimed at investigating
the evolution of PDE activity and expression levels during the course of the
disease in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice, and to evaluate in these mice the biological
and clinical effects of treatments with pentoxifylline, denbufylline and NCS 613 
PDE inhibitors. This study reveals that compared to CBA/J control mice, kidney
PDE4 activity of MRL/lpr mice increases with the disease progression.
Furthermore, it showed that the most potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor NCS 613 
is also the most effective molecule in decreasing proteinuria and increasing
survival rate of MRL/lpr mice. NCS 613 is a potent inhibitor, which is more
selective for the PDE4C subtype (IC₅₀= 1.4 nM) than the other subtypes (PDE4A,
IC₅₀= 44 nM; PDE4B, IC₅₀= 48 nM; and PDE4D, IC₅₀= 14 nM). Interestingly, its
affinity for the High Affinity Rolipram Binding Site is relatively low
(K(i) = 148 nM) in comparison to rolipram (K(i) = 3 nM). Finally, as also
observed using MRL/lpr peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), NCS 613 inhibits
basal and LPS-induced TNFα secretion from PBLs of lupus patients, suggesting a
therapeutic potential of NCS 613 in systemic lupus. This study reveals that PDE4 
represent a potential therapeutic target in lupus disease.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors control A172 human glioblastoma cell death through
cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A and Epac1/Rap1 pathways.

AIMS: We investigated whether cAMP-mediated protein kinase A(PKA) and Epac1/Rap1 
pathways differentially affect brain tumor cell death using
4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidone(rolipram), specific
phosphodiesterase type IV(PDE IV) inhibitor.
MAIN METHODS: A172 and U87MG human glioblastoma cells were used. Percentage of
cell survival was determined by MTT assay. PKA and Epac1/Rap1 activation was
determined by western blotting and pull-down assay, respectively. Cell cycle and 
hypodiploid cell formation were assessed by flow cytometry analysis.
KEY FINDINGS: Non-specific PDE inhibitors, isobutylmethylxanthine(IBMX) and
theophylline reduce survival percentage of A172 and U87MG cells. The expression
of PDE4A and PDE4B was detected in A172 and U87MG cells. Rolipram-treated A172 or
U87MG cell survival was lower in the presence of forskolin, adenylate cyclase
activator, than that in its absence. Co-treatment with rolipram and forskolin
also enhanced CREB phosphorylation on serine 133 that was inhibited by H-89, PKA 
inhibitor and cAMP-responsive guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1(Epac1), a Rap 
GDP exchange factor-mediated Rap1 activity in A172 cells. When A172 cells were
treated with cell-permeable dibutyryl-cAMP(dbcAMP), PKA activator or
8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate(CPT),
Epac1 activator, basal level of cell death was increased and cell cycle was
arrested at the phase of G2/M. Rolipram-induced A172 cell death was also
increased by the co-treatment with dbcAMP or CPT, but it was inhibited by the
pre-treatment with H-89.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that PKA and Epac1/Rap1 pathways could
cooperatively play a role in rolipram-induced brain tumor cell death. It suggests
that rolipram might regulate glioblastoma cell density through dual pathways of
PKA- and Epac1/Rap1-mediated cell death and cell cycle arrest.

Fragment-based screening for inhibitors of PDE4A using enthalpy arrays and X-ray 
crystallography.

Fragment-based screening has typically relied on X-ray or nuclear magnetic
resonance methods to identify low-affinity ligands that bind to therapeutic
targets. These techniques are expensive in terms of material and time, so it
useful to have a higher throughput method to reliably prescreen a fragment
library to identify a subset of compounds for structural analysis. Calorimetry
provides a label-free method to assay binding and enzymatic activity that is
unaffected by the spectroscopic properties of the sample. Conventional
microcalorimetry is hampered by requiring large quantities of reagents and long
measurement times. Nanocalorimeters can overcome these limitations of
conventional isothermal titration calorimetry. Here we have used enthalpy arrays,
which are arrays of nanocalorimeters, to perform an enzyme activity-based
fragment screen for competitive inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A).
Several inhibitors with K ( I ) <2 mM were identified and moved to X-ray
crystallization trials. Although the co-crystals did not yield high-resolution
data, evidence of binding was observed, and the chemical structures of the hits
were consistent with motifs of known PDE4 inhibitors. This study shows how array 
calorimetry can be used as a prescreening method for fragment-based lead
discovery with enzyme targets and provides a list of candidate fragments for
inhibition of PDE4A.

As schizophrenia-like symptoms are produced by administration of phencyclidine
(PCP), a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,
PCP-responsive genes could be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
We injected PCP to Wistar rats and isolated five different parts of the brain in 
1 and 4 hr after the injection. We analyzed the gene expression induced by the
PCP treatment of these tissues using the AGILENT rat cDNA microarray system. We
observed changes in expression level in 90 genes and 21 ESTs after the treatment.
Out of the 10 genes showing >2-fold expressional change evaluated by qRT-PCR, we 
selected 7 genes as subjects for the locus-wide association study to identify
susceptibility genes for schizophrenia in the Japanese population. In haplotype
analysis, significant associations were detected in combinations of two SNPs of
BTG2 (P = 1.4 × 10(-6) ), PDE4A (P = 1.4 × 10(-6) ), and PLAT (P = 1 × 10(-3) ), 
after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Additionally, we not only
successfully replicated the haplotype associations in PDE4A (P = 6.8 × 10(-12) ) 
and PLAT (P = 0.015), but also detected single-point associations of one SNP in
PDE4A (P = 0.0068) and two SNPs in PLAT (P = 0.0260 and 0.0104) in another larger
sample set consisting of 2,224 cases and 2,250 controls. These results indicate
that PDE4A and PLAT may be susceptibility genes for schizophrenia in the Japanese
population.

Phosphodiesterases (PDE) hydrolyse intracellular cAMP and cGMP to inactive 5'
monophosphates. Decreased level of cAMP is involved in the pathogenesis of
asthma. We and others have shown that phosphodiesterases were upregulated in the 
lung of allergic rats, and Bacilli Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induced the production
of cAMP in vitro. However, it is unclear how BCG's effect asthma and whether it
is related to PDEs.In this study, BCG was intraperitoneally injected into male
Sprague-Dawley rats sensitized and later the rats were challenged with
ovabumin/pertusis. The inflammation in lungs was measured. Airway
hyperresponsiveness was determined using MedLab software after intravenous
methacholine challenge. Furthermore, cAMP level and adenylate cyclase activity in
lungs were analyzed by ELISA, phosphodiesterases activities were analyzed by
HPLC, while PDEs mRNA levels in lungs was analyzed by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Administration of BCG significantly
attenuated allergen-induced lung inflammatory response and hyper responsiveness
as compared with vehicle treatment. Furthermore, the levels of cAMP in lungs were
significantly increased in BCG-treated allergic rats. Interestingly,
administration of BCG decreased the activity of cAMP-PDE, but not adenylyl
cyclase (AC), activity in lungs of animals. Furthermore, pretreatment with BCG
significantly decreased the mRNA levels of PDE4A, 4C, 5 and 8, which were induced
in lungs of allergic rats. BCG administration attenuated airway inflammatory
response and bronchial hyper responsiveness in rats, which are the most important
symptoms in asthma. The decreased PDEs mRNA and inhibited cAMP-PDE activities by 
BCG contribute, at least in part, prevention of allergen-induced airway
inflammation and asthma in rats.

(1)Section for Diabetes, Metabolism and Endocrinology, Department of Experimental
Medical Sciences, Lund University Lund, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To locate components and target proteins of relevance for the cAMP and
cGMP signaling networks including cAMP and cGMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs),
salt-inducible kinases (SIKs), subunits of Na+, K+-ATPases, and aquaporins (AQPs)
in the human saccule.
METHODS: The human saccule was dissected out during the removal of vestibular
schwannoma via the translabyrinthine approach and immediately fixed.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using PDE, SIK, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, and AQP
antibodies.
RESULTS: PDEs selective for cAMP (PDE4A, PDE4D, and PDE8A) and cGMP (PDE9A) as
well a dual specificity PDE (PDE10A) were detected in the sensory epithelium of
the saccule. Furthermore, AQP2, 4, and 9, SIK1 and the α-1 subunit of the Na(+), 
K(+)-ATPase were detected.
CONCLUSION: cAMP and cGMP are important regulators of ion and water homeostasis
in the inner ear. The identification of PDEs and SIK1 in the vestibular system
offers new treatment targets for endolymphatic hydrops. Exactly how the PDEs are 
connected to SIK1 and the SIK1 substrate Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and to AQPs 2, 4, 9
remains to be elucidated. The dissection of the signaling networks utilizing
these components and evaluating their roles will add new basic knowledge
regarding inner ear physiology.

RATIONALE: Alteration of dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex,
especially hypofunction of dopamine D1 receptors, contributes to psychotic
symptoms and cognitive deficit in schizophrenia. D1 receptors signal through the 
cAMP/PKA second messenger cascade, which is modulated by phosphodiesterase (PDE) 
enzymes that hydrolyze and inactivate cyclic nucleotides. Though several PDEs are
expressed in cortical neurons, the PDE4 enzyme family (PDE4A-D) has been
implicated in the control of cognitive function. The best studied isoform, PDE4B,
interacts with a schizophrenia susceptibility factor, disrupted in schizophrenia 
1 (DISC1).
OBJECTIVES: We explore the control of mouse frontal cortex dopamine D1 receptor
signaling and associated behavior by PDE4.
RESULTS: Inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram induced activation of cAMP/PKA signaling 
in cortical slices and in vivo, leading to the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 and
other postsynaptic and presynaptic PKA-substrates. Rolipram also enhanced
DARPP-32 phosphorylation invoked by D1 receptor activation. Immunohistochemical
studies demonstrated PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D expression in DARPP-32-positive
neurons in layer VI of frontal cortex, most likely in D1 receptor-positive,
glutamatergic corticothalamic pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, the ability of
rolipram treatment to improve the performance of mice in a sensorimotor gating
test was DARPP-32-dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: PDE4, which is co-expressed with DARPP-32 in D1 receptor-positive
cortical pyramidal neurons in layer VI, modulates the level of D1 receptor
signaling and DARPP-32 phosphorylation in the frontal cortex, likely influencing 
cognitive function. These biochemical and behavioral actions of PDE4 inhibitors
may contribute to the hypothesized antipsychotic actions of this class of
compounds.

INTRODUCTION: Phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes have been shown to play a role
in the control of human male genital tissues. There are hints from basic research
and clinical studies that PDE5 inhibitors may have the ability to retard the male
ejaculatory response. While the expression of PDE isoenzymes in the human seminal
vesicles (SVs) has been described, the distribution of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (AMP)- and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-PDEs has not yet
been investigated.
AIM: The aim of this study was to elucidate the expression and distribution of
PDE isoenzymes PDE3A, PDE4 (isoforms A and B), PDE5A, and PDE11A in human SV
tissue.
METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry (double-labeling techniques, laser
fluorescence microscopy), the occurrence of PDE3A, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE5A, and
PDE11A, the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP), and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) was examined in sections
of SV. Cytosolic supernatants prepared from isolated human SV tissue were
subjected to Western blot analysis using specific anti-PDE antibodies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The expression and distribution by of PDE3A, PDE4A, PDE4B, 
PDE5A, and PDE11A in the human SV were investigated by means of
immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Immunosignals specific for PDE3A were seen in both the smooth muscle and
the glandular epithelium, whereas staining for PDE4A, PDE5A, and PDE11A was
mainly limited to epithelial cells. Varicose nerve fibers transversing the
sections also presented staining for PDE3A. In nerve fibers and nerve endings,
PDE4A and PDE4B were found co-localized with VIP; PDE5A-positive nerves also
presented immunosignals specific for CGRP. The expression of said PDE isoenzymes 
was confirmed by Western blotting.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-PDE isoenzymes 
are involved in the control of secretory activity and efferent neurotransmission 
in the SV. These findings might be of importance with regard to the
identification of new therapeutic avenues to treat premature ejaculation.

on human lung tissues.

Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of pulmonary diseases, which leads to lung
parenchyma destruction (emphysema) and obstructive bronchiolitis occurring in
both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Inflammation is strongly
correlated with low intracellular cAMP levels and increase in specific cAMP
hydrolyzing activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of
the cyclic phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) in human lung and to determine the
effects of NCS 613, a new PDE4 inhibitor, on lung inflammation and bronchial
hyperresponsiveness. High cAMP-PDE activities were found in the cytosoluble
fractions from human lung parenchyma and distal bronchi. PDE4 (rolipram
sensitive) represented 40% and 56% of total cAMP-PDE activities in the
above-corresponding tissues. Moreover, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D isoforms
were detected in all three subcellular fractions (cytosolic, microsomal, and
nuclear) with differential distributions according to specific variants.
Pharmacological treatments with NCS 613 significantly decreased PDE4 activity and
reduced IκBα degradation in cultured parenchyma, both of which are usually
correlated with a lower inflammation status. Moreover, NCS 613 pretreatment
potentiated isoproterenol-induced relaxations in human distal bronchi, while
reducing TNF-α-induced hyperresponsiveness in cultured bronchi, as assessed in
the presence of methacholine, U-46619, or histamine. This reducing effect of NCS 
613 on human bronchi hyperresponsiveness triggered by TNF-α was related to a
lower expression level of PDE4B and PDE4C, as well as a downregulation of the
phosphorylated forms of p38-MAPK, CPI-17, and MYPT-1, which are known to control 
tone. In conclusion, specific PDE4 inhibitors, such as NCS 613, may represent an 
alternative and isoform-specific approach toward reducing human lung inflammation
and airway overreactivity.

Predicting off-targets by computational methods is gaining increasing interest in
early-stage drug discovery. Here, we present a computational method based on full
3D comparisons of 3D structures. When a similar binding site is detected in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (or any protein structure database), it is possible that 
the corresponding ligand also binds to that similar site. On one hand, this
target hopping case is probably rare because it requires a high similarity
between the binding sites. On the other hand, it could be a strong rational
evidence to highlight possible off-target reactions and possibly a potential
undesired side effect. This target-based drug repurposing can be extended a
significant step further with the capability of searching the full surface of all
proteins in the PDB, and therefore not relying on pocket detection. Using this
approach, we describe how MED-SuMo reproduces the repurposing of tadalafil from
PDE5A to PDE4A and a structure of PDE4A with tadalafil. Searching for local
protein similarities generates more hits than for whole binding site similarities
and therefore fragment repurposing is more likely to occur than for drug-sized
compounds. In this work, we illustrate that by mining the PDB for proteins
sharing similarities with the hinge region of protein kinases. The experimentally
validated examples, biotin carboxylase and synapsin, are retrieved. Further to
fragment repurposing, this approach can be applied to the detection of druggable 
sites from 3D structures. This is illustrated with detection of the protein
kinase hinge motif in the HIV-RT non-nucleosidic allosteric site.

NADPH oxidase 4 mediates upregulation of type 4 phosphodiesterases in human
endothelial cells.

(1)Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.

The protective actions of prostacyclin (PGI(2) ) are mediated by cyclic AMP
(cAMP) which is reduced by type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4) which hydrolyze cAMP.
Superoxide (O2(-)) from NADPH oxidase (Nox) is associated with impaired PGI(2)
bioactivity. The objective of this study, therefore, was to study the
relationship between Nox and PDE4 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were incubated with the thromboxane A(2) analog, U46619,
8-isoprostane F(2α) (8IP), or tumor necrosing factor alpha (TNFα) [±iloprost (a
PGI(2) analog)] and the expression of PDE4A, B, C, and D and splice variants
thereof assessed using Western blotting and qPCR and mRNA silencing of Nox4 and
Nox5. Effects on cell replication and angiogenesis were also studied. U46619,
8IP, and TNFα increased the expression of Nox 4 and Nox 5 and all PDE4 isoforms
as well as cell replication and tubule formation (index of angiogenesis), effects
inhibited by mRNA silencing of Nox4 (but not Nox5) and iloprost and rolipram.
These data demonstrate that upregulation of Nox4 leads to an upregulation of
PDE4A, B, and D and increased hydrolysis of cAMP which in turn augments cell
replication and angiogenesis. This mechanism may be central to vasculopathies
associated with endothelial dysfunction since the PGI(2)-cAMP signaling axis
plays a key role in mediating functions that include hemostasis and angiogenesis.

β-Adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) enhance cardiac contractility by increasing cAMP
levels and activating PKA. PKA increases Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release via
phosphorylation of L-type Ca²⁺ channels (LTCCs) and ryanodine receptor 2.
Multiple cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate local cAMP
concentration in cardiomyocytes, with PDE4 being predominant for the control of
β-AR-dependent cAMP signals. Three genes encoding PDE4 are expressed in mouse
heart: Pde4a, Pde4b, and Pde4d. Here we show that both PDE4B and PDE4D are
tethered to the LTCC in the mouse heart but that β-AR stimulation of the L-type
Ca²⁺ current (ICa,L) is increased only in Pde4b-/- mice. A fraction of PDE4B
colocalized with the LTCC along T-tubules in the mouse heart. Under β-AR
stimulation, Ca²⁺ transients, cell contraction, and spontaneous Ca²⁺ release
events were increased in Pde4b-/- and Pde4d-/- myocytes compared with those in WT
myocytes. In vivo, after intraperitoneal injection of isoprenaline,
catheter-mediated burst pacing triggered ventricular tachycardia in Pde4b-/- mice
but not in WT mice. These results identify PDE4B in the CaV1.2 complex as a
critical regulator of ICa,L during β-AR stimulation and suggest that distinct
PDE4 subtypes are important for normal regulation of Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release in
cardiomyocytes.

cytokine-induced proliferation and myofibroblast conversion.

Lung fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts are
pathological key events during development of lung fibrosis. Cyclic nucleotide
signaling is described as a negative modulator of these cellular processes, and
cyclic nucleotide degrading type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4) are important
regulators of these pathways. In this study, we elucidated expression and the
role of individual subtypes of PDE4 in primary normal human lung fibroblast
(NHLF) in controlling cytokines-induced proliferation and conversion to
myofibroblasts by short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) induced knockdown. We verified 
the expression of PDE4A, B, and D, while PDE4C was only minor or even not
expressed in NHLF. An efficient liposome-mediated transfection method for mRNA
silencing and a knockdown of the expressed PDE4 subtypes was achieved in these
cells. This knockdown was further validated by PDE4 protein expression analysis
and PDE4 activity measurements. Functionally, the knockdown of PDE4A and PDE4B
inhibited proliferation induced by the cytokine combination of bFGF and IL-1β,
whereas knockdown of PDE4D was ineffective. In contrast, TGF-β induced
differentiation into myofibroblasts was affected by knockdown of PDE4B and PDE4D,
but not by PDE4A knockdown. In summary, our data allow to assign different PDE4
subtypes to distinct functions of human lung fibroblasts and highlight the
predominant role of PDE4B in controlling pathophysiological processes of human
lung fibroblasts. This provides a scientific rationale for focused therapeutic
targeting of PDE4B to treat respiratory diseases with fibrotic lesions in the
lung.

Pharmacological doses of testosterone upregulated androgen receptor and
3-Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta-5-delta-4 isomerase and impaired leydig
cells steroidogenesis in adult rats.

Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are testosterone derivatives originally
designed to enhance muscular mass and used for the treatment of many clinical
conditions as well as in contraception. Despite popular interest and abuse, we
still lack a broad understanding of effects of AAS on synthesis of steroid
hormones on the molecular level. This study was designed to systematically
analyze the effects of pharmacological/high doses of testosterone on
steroidogenic machinery in Leydig cells. Two different experimental approaches
were used: (1) In vivo experiment on groups of adult male rats treated with
testosterone for 1 day, 2 weeks, and 2 months; (2) Direct in vitro testosterone
treatment of Leydig cells isolated from intact rats. Result showed that prolonged
in vivo treatment with testosterone decreased the expression of Scarb1 (scavenger
receptor class B type 1), Tspo (translocator protein), Star (steroidogenic acute 
regulatory protein), Cyp11a1 (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme), and
Cyp17a1 (17α-hydroxylase/17, 20 lyase) in Leydig cells. Oppositely, the
expression of Hsd3b (3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta-5-delta-4
isomerase), Ar (androgen receptor), and Pde4a/b (cyclic adenosine
monophosphate-dependent phosphodiesterases) was increased. Androgenization for 2 
weeks inhibited Cyp19 (aromatase) transcription, whereas 2-month exposure caused 
the opposite effect. Direct in vitro testosterone treatment also decreased the
expression of Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Cyp19a1, whereas Hsd3b was upregulated. The
results of expression analysis were supported by declined steroidogenic capacity 
and activity of Leydig cells, although conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone
was stimulated. The upregulation of AR and 3βHSD in testosterone-impaired Leydig 
cells steroidogenesis could be the possible mechanism that maintain and prevent
loss of steroidogenic function.

S-adenosylmethionine decreases lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphodiesterase 4B2
and attenuates tumor necrosis factor expression via cAMP/protein kinase A
pathway.

S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) treatment has anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective
effects against endotoxin-induced organ injury. An important component of the
anti-inflammatory action of SAM involves down-regulation of the
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcriptional induction of tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF) expression by monocytes/macrophages. We examined the effect of SAM
on expression and activity of LPS-induced up-regulation of phosphodiesterase 4
(PDE4), which regulates cellular cAMP levels and TNF expression. LPS treatment of
RAW 264.7, a mouse macrophage cell line, led to the induction of Pde4b2 mRNA
expression with no effect on Pde4a or Pde4d. SAM pretreatment led to a
significant decrease in LPS-induced up-regulation of Pde4b2 expression in both
RAW 264.7 cells and primary human CD14(+) monocytes. Of note, the decreased
Pde4b2 mRNA expression correlated with the SAM-dependent increase in the
transcriptionally repressive histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation on the Pde4b2
intronic promoter region. The SAM-mediated decrease in LPS-inducible Pde4b2
up-regulation resulted in an increase in cellular cAMP levels and activation of
cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which plays an inhibitory role in
LPS-induced TNF production. In addition, SAM did not affect LPS-inducible
inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB degradation or nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-p65
translocation into the nucleus but rather inhibited NF-κB transcriptional
activity. These results demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of
LPS-induced PDE4B2 up-regulation and increased cAMP-dependent PKA activation are 
significant mechanisms contributing to the anti-TNF effect of SAM. Moreover,
these data also suggest that SAM may be used as an effective PDE4B inhibitor in
the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders in which TNF expression plays a
significant pathogenic role.

Phosphodiesterase-4D knock-out and RNA interference-mediated knock-down enhance
memory and increase hippocampal neurogenesis via increased cAMP signaling.

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) plays an important role in mediating memory via the
control of intracellular cAMP signaling; inhibition of PDE4 enhances memory.
However, development of PDE4 inhibitors as memory enhancers has been hampered by 
their major side effect of emesis. PDE4 has four subtypes (PDE4A-D) consisting of
25 splice variants. Mice deficient in PDE4D displayed memory enhancement in
radial arm maze, water maze, and object recognition tests. These effects were
mimicked by repeated treatment with rolipram in wild-type mice. In addition,
similarly as rolipram-treated wild-type mice, PDE4D-deficient mice also displayed
increased hippocampal neurogenesis and phosphorylated cAMP response
element-binding protein (pCREB). Furthermore, microinfusion of lentiviral vectors
that contained microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting long-form PDE4D isoforms into
bilateral dentate gyri of the mouse hippocampus downregulated PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, 
enhanced memory, and increased hippocampal neurogenesis and pCREB. Finally, while
rolipram and PDE4D deficiency shortened α2 adrenergic receptor-mediated
anesthesia, a surrogate measure of emesis, miRNA-mediated PDE4D knock-down in the
hippocampus did not. The present results suggest that PDE4D, in particular
long-form PDE4D, plays a critical role in the mediation of memory and hippocampal
neurogenesis, which are mediated by cAMP/CREB signaling; reduced expression of
PDE4D, or at least PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, in the hippocampus enhances memory but
appears not to cause emesis. These novel findings will aid in the development of 
PDE4 subtype- or variant-selective inhibitors for treatment of disorders
involving impaired cognition, including Alzheimer's disease.

Phosphodiesterase 4B is essential for T(H)2-cell function and development of
airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic asthma.

BACKGROUND: Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling modulates functions of inflammatory cells
involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, and type 4 cAMP-specific
phosphodiesterases (PDE4s) are essential components of this pathway. Induction of
the PDE4 isoform PDE4B is necessary for Toll-like receptor signaling in monocytes
and macrophages and is associated with T cell receptor/CD3 in T cells; however,
its exact physiological function in the development of allergic asthma remains
undefined.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the role of PDE4B in the development of
allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and T(H)2-driven inflammatory
responses.
METHODS: Wild-type and PDE4B(-/-) mice were sensitized and challenged with
ovalbumin and AHR measured in response to inhaled methacholine. Airway
inflammation was characterized by analyzing leukocyte infiltration and cytokine
accumulation in the airways. Ovalbumin-stimulated cell proliferation and T(H)2
cytokine production were determined in cultured bronchial lymph node cells.
RESULTS: Mice deficient in PDE4B do not develop AHR. This protective effect was
associated with a significant decrease in eosinophils recruitment to the lungs
and decreased T(H)2 cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Defects 
in T-cell replication, T(H)2 cytokine production, and dendritic cell migration
were evident in cells from the airway-draining lymph nodes. Conversely,
accumulation of the T(H)1 cytokine IFN-γ was not affected in PDE4B(-/-) mice.
Ablation of the orthologous PDE4 gene PDE4A has no impact on airway inflammation.
CONCLUSION: By relieving a cAMP-negative constraint, PDE4B plays an essential
role in T(H)2-cell activation and dendritic cell recruitment during airway
inflammation. These findings provide proof of concept that PDE4 inhibitors with
PDE4B selectivity may have efficacy in asthma treatment.

Regulation of 3',5'-cAMP in preglomerular smooth muscle and endothelial cells
from genetically hypertensive rats.

Our previous studies show that inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) augments 
agonist-induced renovascular 3',5'-cAMP secretion more in isolated, perfused
kidneys from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) versus Wistar-Kyoto
normotensive rats (WKY); however, whether this is because of PDE4 inhibition in
renovascular smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells is unknown. Therefore, we
examined the effects of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (broad-spectrum PDE
inhibitor) and RO 20-1724 (selective PDE4 inhibitor) on isoproterenol-induced
3',5'-cAMP levels in cultured WKY and SHR preglomerular vascular smooth muscle
and endothelial cells. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and RO 20-1724 augmented
isoproterenol-induced 3',5'-cAMP levels similarly in WKY versus SHR endothelial
cells. In contrast, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and RO 20-1724 augmented
isoproterenol-induced 3',5'-cAMP levels significantly more in SHR, compared to
WKY, smooth muscle cells (P<0.0001). In both cell types from both rat strains,
mRNA levels for the PDE4B subtype exceeded levels for the PDE4A, PDE4C, and PDE4D
subtypes, and small interfering RNA knockdown of PDE4B mRNA in SHR smooth muscle 
cells increased isoproterenol-induced 3',5'-cAMP. mRNA levels for the PDE4B2
variant exceeded levels for the PDE4B1, PDE4B3, PDE4B4, and PDE4B5 variants. In
vivo, infusions of RO 20-1724 increased the urinary excretion of 3',5'-cAMP more 
in SHR than WKY (P=0.0211). We conclude that (1) the greater effect of PDE4
inhibition on renovascular 3',5'-cAMP is mediated by inhibition of PDE4 in
renovascular smooth muscle cells, not endothelial cells; (2) the major PDE4
subtype in both renovascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells is PDE4B with
variant PDE4B2 likely being dominant; and (3) inhibition of PDE4 in vivo
increases renal 3',5'-cAMP levels more in genetically hypertensive rats.

An evolutionary analysis of cAMP-specific Phosphodiesterase 4 alternative
splicing.

BACKGROUND: Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze the
intracellular second messengers: cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic
guanine monophosphate (cGMP). The cAMP-specific PDE family 4 (PDE4) is widely
expressed in vertebrates. Each of the four PDE4 gene isoforms (PDE4 A-D) undergo 
extensive alternative splicing via alternative transcription initiation sites,
producing unique amino termini and yielding multiple splice variant forms from
each gene isoform termed long, short, super-short and truncated super-short. Many
species across the vertebrate lineage contain multiple splice variants of each
gene type, which are characterized by length and amino termini.
RESULTS: A phylogenetic approach was used to visualize splice variant form
genesis and identify conserved splice variants (genome conservation with EST
support) across the vertebrate taxa. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic
inference indicated PDE4 gene duplication occurred at the base of the vertebrate 
lineage and reveals additional gene duplications specific to the teleost lineage.
Phylogenetic inference and PDE4 splice variant presence, or absence as determined
by EST screens, were further supported by the genomic analysis of select
vertebrate taxa. Two conserved PDE4 long form splice variants were found in each 
of the PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4C genes, and eight conserved long forms from the
PDE4 D gene. Conserved short and super-short splice variants were found from each
of the PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4 D genes, while truncated super-short variants were 
found from the PDE4C and PDE4 D genes. PDE4 long form splice variants were found 
in all taxa sampled (invertebrate through mammals); short, super-short, and
truncated super-short are detected primarily in tetrapods and mammals, indicating
an increasing complexity in both alternative splicing and cAMP metabolism through
vertebrate evolution.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a progressive independent incorporation of multiple PDE4
splice variant forms and amino termini, increasing PDE4 proteome complexity from 
primitive vertebrates to humans. While PDE4 gene isoform duplicates with limited 
alternative splicing were found in teleosts, an expansion of both PDE4 splice
variant forms, and alternatively spliced amino termini predominantly occurs in
mammals. Since amino termini have been linked to intracellular targeting of the
PDE4 enzymes, the conservation of amino termini in PDE4 splice variants in
evolution highlights the importance of compartmentalization of PDE4-mediated cAMP
hydrolysis.

cAMP/cGMP signaling pathway.

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra), a cGMP-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, 
is widely used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
In contrast to its well established action on erectile dysfunction, little is
known on the action of sildenafil on cGMP/cAMP signaling and testicular
steroidogenesis. This study was designed to assess the effects of prolonged
sildenafil treatment on NO synthase-dependent signaling and steroidogenic
function of rat Leydig cells. Male adult rats were treated with Viagra (1.25
mg/kg body wt) daily for 30 days. In our studies, serum testosterone and ex vivo 
testosterone production significantly increased in sildenafil-treated animals.
Human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated testosterone production and cAMP
accumulation were also significantly higher in Leydig cells obtained from
sildenafil-treated rats. The expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase (GUCY1)
subunits (Gucy1a1, Gucy1b1) significantly increased; cAMP-specific Pde4a,
cGMP-specific Pde6c, and dual Pde1c and Nos2 were inhibited and expression of
Nos3, protein kinase G1 (Pkg1), and Pde5 remained unchanged. Treatment of
purified Leydig cells with NO donor caused a dose-dependent increase in both
testosterone and cGMP production. Testosterone and cGMP production was
significantly higher in Leydig cells obtained from sildenafil-treated animals.
The stimulatory effect of NO donor was significantly enhanced by saturating
concentrations of hCG in both Leydig cells obtained from control and
sildenafil-treated animals. Occurrence of mature steroidogenic acute regulatory
protein also increased in sildenafil treated animals in accord with increased
cAMP and cGMP production. In summary, inhibition of PDE activity during prolonged
sildenafil treatment increased serum testosterone level and Leydig cells'
steroidogenic capacity by coordinated stimulatory action on cAMP and cGMP
signaling pathway.

During the perinatal period, lungs undergo changes to adapt to air breathing. The
genes involved in these changes are developmentally regulated by various
signaling pathways, including the cyclic nucleotide cAMP. As PDE4s are critical
enzymes for regulation of cAMP levels, the objective of this study was to
investigate PDE4's ontogeny in developing rat lung during the perinatal period.
Pulmonary PDE4 activity, PDE4A-D, PDE4B, and PDE4D variant expression levels,
PDE4B and PDE4D protein levels, and PDE4D localization in distal lung were
determined. PDE4 activity increased towards term, dropped at birth, and increased
thereafter to reach a plateau at the end of the second week of life. PDE4B2 and
PDE4D long forms demonstrated a pattern of expression that increased markedly at 
birth. After birth, PDE4D was expressed in alveolar epithelial and mesenchymal
cells. The study, therefore, evidenced striking variations in expression patterns
among the PDE4 family that differed from changes in global PDE4 activity.

OBJECTIVE: Non-pituitary tumors have been reported in a subset of patients
harboring germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein
(AIP) gene. However, no detailed investigations of non-pituitary tumors of
AIP-mutated patients have been reported so far.
PATIENTS: We examined a MEN1- and p53-negative mother-daughter pair with
acromegaly due to somatotropinoma. Subsequently, the mother developed a large
virilizing adrenocortical carcinoma and a grade II B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
DESIGN: Mutational analysis was performed by automated sequencing.
Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was carried out by sequencing and
microsatellite analysis. AIP expression was assessed through quantitative PCR
(qPCR) and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The functional inactivating mutation c.241C>T (R81X), which blocks the
AIP protein from interacting with phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A), was identified in
the heterozygous state in the leukocyte DNA of both patients. Analyzing the
tumoral DNA revealed that the AIP wild-type allele was lost in the daughter's
somatotropinoma and the mother's adrenocortical carcinoma. Both tumors displayed 
low AIP protein expression levels. Low AIP gene expression was confirmed by qPCR 
in the adrenocortical carcinoma. No evidence of LOH was observed in the DNA
sample from the mother's B-cell lymphoma, and this tumor displayed normal AIP
immunostaining.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents the first molecular analysis of non-pituitary
tumors in AIP-mutated patients. The finding of AIP inactivation in the
adrenocortical tumor suggests that further investigation of the potential role of
this recently identified tumor suppressor gene in non-pituitary tumors, mainly in
those tumors in which the cAMP and the 11q13 locus are implicated, is likely to
be worthwhile.

Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, i.e. rolipram, are being extensively
investigated as therapeutic agents in several diseases. Emesis is one of the most
common side effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Given the fact that the area postrema is 
considered the chemoreceptor trigger zone for vomiting, the present study
investigates the regional distribution and cellular localization of the four gene
transcripts of the PDE4 subfamily (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C and PDE4D) in human
brainstem. In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to locate the mRNA
distribution of the four PDE4 subfamilies in the area postrema and related nuclei
of human postmortem brainstem. We have found that in the brainstem PDE4B and
PDE4D mRNA expression is abundant and distributed not only in neuronal cells, but
also in glial cells, and on blood vessels. The hybridization signals for PDE4B
and PDE4D mRNAs in the area postrema were stronger than those in any other nuclei
in the brainstem. They were also found in vomiting-related nuclei such as the
nucleus of the solitary tract and the dorsal vagal motor nucleus. These findings 
suggest that cAMP signaling modification in the area postrema could mediate the
emetic effects of PDE4 inhibitors in human brainstem.

Our laboratory has recently demonstrated altered expression of phosphodiesterase 
(PDE) 4A and 4B in subjects with autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia,
suggesting disrupted cAMP signaling in these diagnostic groups. In the current
study, we measured expression of PDEs in rat frontal cortex (FC) following
chronic treatment with clozapine, fluoxetine, haloperidol, lithium, olanzapine,
valproic acid (VPA), or sterile saline for 21 days. Western blotting experiments 
showed decreased expression of PDE4A subtypes in FC following treatment with
clozapine, haloperidol, lithium, and VPA. PDE4B subtypes were similarly reduced
in FC following treatment with clozapine, fluoxetine, and lithium. We also
measured levels of nine PDE subtypes via qRT-PCR in FC and found significant
upregulation of PDE1A and PDE8B following treatment with olanzapine, while
treatment with lithium reduced expression of mRNA for PDE8B. Our results
demonstrate altered expression of PDE4A and PDE4B in response to a variety of
psychotropic medications suggesting potentially new therapeutic avenues for
treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases.

Enzymes from the PDE (phosphodiesterase) 4 cAMP-specific PDE family are crucial
for the maintenance of compartmentalized cAMP responses in many cell types.
Regulation of PDE activity can be achieved via post-translational modification
such as phosphorylation by ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) MAPKs
(mitogen-activated protein kinases) and PKA (protein kinase A). In the present
paper, we report for the first time that PDE4 isoforms from the PDE4A and PDE4D
subfamilies can be selectively modified by SUMO (small ubiquitin-related
modifier). We have identified a single SUMO site within a consensus tetrapeptide 
motif, PsiKXE (where Psi represents a hydrophobic residue), which lies in the
catalytic unit of these enzymes. SUMO modification of PDE4 at this site was
observed upon overexpression of the SUMO E3 ligase PIASy [protein inhibitor of
activated STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) Y] in HEK
(human embryonic kidney)-293 cells and we identify PIASy as a novel binding
partner for long PDE4 isoforms. Site-directed mutagenesis of the acceptor lysine 
residue ablated conjugation of PDE4 with SUMO, suggesting the presence of a
single SUMO site in the first subdomain of the conserved PDE4 catalytic unit.
This observation was supported by both cell-free in vitro SUMOylation assays and 
analysis of SUMOylated spot-immobilized peptide arrays. SUMO modification of long
PDE4 isoforms serves to augment their activation by PKA phosphorylation and
repress their inhibition by ERK phosphorylation. Following ligation of
beta-adrenergic receptors, SUMOylation of PDE4 isoforms sufficiently amplified
PKA-stimulated PDE4 activity to reduce markedly the PKA phosphorylation status of
the beta2-adrenergic receptor. These results highlight a new means whereby cells 
might achieve the selective regulation of the activity of cAMP-specific PDE4
enyzmes.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has emerged as a critical event in the
pathogenesis of organ fibrosis and cancer and is typically induced by the
multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. The present
study was undertaken to evaluate the potential role of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 
in TGF-beta1-induced EMT in the human alveolar epithelial type II cell line A549.
Stimulation of A549 with TGF-beta1 induced EMT by morphological alterations and
by expression changes of the epithelial phenotype markers E-cadherin,
cytokeratin-18, zona occludens-1, and the mesenchymal phenotype markers, collagen
I, fibronectin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Interestingly, TGF-beta1
stimulation caused twofold increase in total cAMP-PDE activity, contributed
mostly by PDE4. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expression demonstrated
up-regulation of PDE4A and PDE4D isoforms in TGF-beta1-stimulated cells. Most
importantly, treatment of TGF-beta1 stimulated epithelial cells with the
PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram or PDE4 small interfering RNA potently
inhibited EMT changes in a Smad-independent manner by decreasing reactive oxygen 
species, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. In
contrast, the ectopic overexpression of PDE4A and/or PDE4D resulted in a
significant loss of epithelial marker E-cadherin but did not result in changes of
mesenchymal markers. In addition, Rho kinase signaling activated by TGF-beta1
during EMT demonstrated to be a positive regulator of PDE4. Collectively, the
findings presented herein suggest that TGF-beta1 mediated up-regulation of PDE4
promotes EMT in alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, targeting PDE4 isoforms may be a
novel approach to attenuate EMT-associated lung diseases such as pulmonary
fibrosis and lung cancer.

RATIONALE: Multiple cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) degrade cAMP in
cardiomyocytes but the role of PDEs in controlling cAMP signaling during
pathological cardiac hypertrophy is poorly defined.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the beta-adrenergic regulation of cardiac contractility and
characterize the changes in cardiomyocyte cAMP signals and cAMP-PDE expression
and activity following cardiac hypertrophy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in rats by thoracic aortic
banding over a time period of 5 weeks and was confirmed by anatomic measurements 
and echocardiography. Ex vivo myocardial function was evaluated in
Langendorff-perfused hearts. Engineered cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels
were expressed in single cardiomyocytes to monitor subsarcolemmal cAMP using
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of the associated CNG current (I(CNG)). PDE
variant activity and protein level were determined in purified cardiomyocytes.
Aortic stenosis rats exhibited a 67% increase in heart weight compared to
sham-operated animals. The inotropic response to maximal beta-adrenergic
stimulation was reduced by approximately 54% in isolated hypertrophied hearts,
along with a approximately 32% decrease in subsarcolemmal cAMP levels in
hypertrophied myocytes. Total cAMP hydrolytic activity as well as PDE3 and PDE4
activities were reduced in hypertrophied myocytes, because of a reduction of
PDE3A, PDE4A, and PDE4B, whereas PDE4D was unchanged. Regulation of
beta-adrenergic cAMP signals by PDEs was blunted in hypertrophied myocytes, as
demonstrated by the diminished effects of IBMX (100 micromol/L) and of both the
PDE3 inhibitor cilostamide (1 micromol/L) and the PDE4 inhibitor Ro 201724 (10
micromol/L).
CONCLUSIONS: Beta-adrenergic desensitization is accompanied by a reduction in
cAMP-PDE and an altered modulation of beta-adrenergic cAMP signals in cardiac
hypertrophy.

Stimulation of the cAMP signaling pathway has been shown to induce apoptosis and 
augment the effects of glucocorticoids in inducing apoptosis in leukemic cells.
We recently reported that in primary B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemic (B-CLL) 
cells, apoptosis could be induced by stimulating the cAMP signaling pathway with 
a phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) inhibitor alone; while in contrast, in the CEM T
leukemic cell line, PDE4 inhibitors alone were ineffective, and concurrent
stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was required to see effects [Tiwari et al.
(2005)]. We report here that in the CEM and Jurkat T leukemic cell lines, the
most abundantly expressed PDEs are PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4D, PDE7A, and PDE8A.
Selective inhibition of PDE3, PDE4 or PDE7 alone produces little effect on cell
viability, but inhibition of all three of these PDEs together dramatically
enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in CEM cells, and overcomes
glucocorticoid resistance in a glucocorticoid-resistant CEM cell line. These
studies indicate that for some leukemic cell types, a desired therapeutic effect 
may be achieved by inhibiting more than one form of PDE.

Cyclic AMP is part of an endogenous mechanism that downregulates inflammatory
response, and its intracellular concentration is regulated chiefly by cyclic
nucleotide phosphodiesterases type 4. The goal of the present study was to
determine whether phosphodiesterases 4 are involved in the inflammatory response 
of astrocytes mediated by Toll-like receptors. Astrocyte cultures established
from newborn rat brain were challenged with lipoteichoic acid, a ligand of
Toll-like receptor 2, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, a ligand of Toll-like
receptor 3, or lipopolysaccharide, a ligand of Toll-like receptor 4. After 24 h
the expression of genes encoding phosphodiesterase 4A, phosphodiesterase 4B and
phosphodiesterase 4D was determined by real time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction. The challenge of astrocytes with the ligands profoundly
up-regulated expression of the phosphodiesterase 4B mRNA, while the
phosphodiesterase 4A and 4D mRNA was either unaffected or downregulated.
Moreover, Toll-like receptor ligation specifically up-regulated expression of the
phosphodiesterase 4B2 transcriptional variant. Thus, polyinosinic-polycytidylic
acid, lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid induced approximately 7-, 5- and
4-fold up-regulation of the message, respectively. Toll-like receptor ligation
also led to an over 2-fold increase in the protein level of phosphodiesterase 4B2
as revealed by immunoblot analysis. The inactivation of Rho proteins by
pretreatment with toxin B form C. difficile enhanced ligation-induced
up-regulation of the phosphodiesterase 4B2 message by 4-9-fold. However, in spite
of this increase in the message abundance, there was no increase in the protein
level compared to cells challenged with the ligands alone. These results
demonstrate that the phosphodiesterase 4B2 gene is an effector of Toll-like
receptor signaling in astrocytes, and that its up-regulation at the protein level
is controlled by complex mechanisms.

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are important regulators of signal transduction
processes. While much is known about the function of cyclic GMP-specific PDEs in 
the retina, much less is known about the closely related, cyclic AMP-specific
PDEs. The purpose of the present study is to characterize and localize PDE4
within the adult rat retina. We have used Western blotting, RT-PCR, and
immunohistochemistry together with retrograde labeling to determine the presence 
and location of each PDE4 subtype. Western blot analysis revealed that multiple
isoforms of PDE4A, B, and D subtypes are present within the retina, whereas the
PDE4C subtype was absent. These data were confirmed by RT-PCR. Using
immunohistochemistry we show that all three PDE4s are abundantly expressed within
the retina where they all colocalize with retrograde-labeled retinal ganglion
cells, as well as bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and cholinergic amacrine
cells, whereas Müller cells lack PDE4 expression. Uniquely, PDE4B was expressed
by the inner and outer segments of rod photoreceptors as well as their terminals 
within the outer plexiform layer. Collectively, our results demonstrate that
PDE4s are abundantly expressed throughout the rodent retina and this study
provides the framework for further functional studies.

An expansion of structure-activity studies on a series of substituted
7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine PDE4 inhibitors and the introduction 
of a related [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine based inhibitor of PDE4 is
presented. The development of SAR included strategic incorporation of known
substituents on the critical catachol diether moiety of the 6-phenyl appendage on
each heterocyclic core. From these studies,
(R)-3-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-6-(4-methoxy-3-(tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)phenyl)-7H-[1
,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine (10) and
(R)-3-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-6-(4-methoxy-3-(tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)phenyl)-[1,2,
4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine (18) were identified as highly potent PDE4A
inhibitors. Each of these analogues was submitted across a panel of 21 PDE family
members and was shown to be highly selective for PDE4 isoforms (PDE4A, PDE4B,
PDE4C, PDE4D). Both 10 and 18 were then evaluated in divergent cell-based assays 
to assess their relevant use as probes of PDE4 activity. Finally, docking studies
with selective ligands (including 10 and 18) were undertaken to better understand
this chemotypes ability to bind and inhibit PDE4 selectively.
