Mutations in the cytosolic 5' nucleotidase II (NT5C2) gene drive resistance to
thiopurine chemotherapy in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Mechanistically, NT5C2 mutant proteins have increased nucleotidase activity as a 
result of altered activating and autoregulatory switch-off mechanisms. Leukemia
cells harboring activating NT5C2 mutations are chemo-resistant to
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), yet show impaired proliferative and self-renewal
capacity. Direct inhibition of NT5C2 or pharmacologic targeting of compensatory
pathways active in NT5C2 mutant cells may antagonize the emergence of NT5C2
mutant clones driving resistance and relapse in ALL.

We previously investigated whether inhibition of AMP-metabolizing enzymes could
enhance AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in skeletal muscle for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. Soluble 5'-nucleotidase II (NT5C2) hydrolyzes IMP
and its inhibition could potentially lead to a rise in AMP to activate AMPK. In
the present study, we investigated effects of NT5C2 deletion in mice fed a
normal-chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD). On a NCD, NT5C2 deletion did not
result in any striking metabolic phenotype. On a HFD however, NT5C2 knockout
(NT5C2-/-) mice displayed reduced body/fat weight gain, improved glucose
tolerance, reduced plasma insulin, triglyceride and uric acid levels compared
with wild-type (WT) mice. There was a tendency towards smaller and fewer
adipocytes in epididymal fat from NT5C2-/- mice compared to WT mice, consistent
with a reduction in triglyceride content. Differences in fat mass under HFD could
not be explained by changes in mRNA expression profiles of epididymal fat from WT
versus NT5C2-/- mice. However, rates of lipolysis tended to increase in
epididymal fat pads from NT5C2-/- versus WT mice, which might explain reduced fat
mass. In incubated skeletal muscles, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and
associated signalling were enhanced in NT5C2-/- versus WT mice on HFD, which
might contribute towards improved glycemic control. In summary, NT5C2 deletion in
mice protects against HFD-induced weight gain, adiposity, insulin resistance and 
associated hyperglycemia.

The development of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) inhibitors is essential
to validate cN-II as a potential target for the reversion of resistance to
cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. We previously reported a fragment-based approach 
combined with molecular modelling, herein, the selected hit-fragments were used
again in another computational approach based on the Ilib-diverse (a software
enabling to build virtual molecule libraries through fragment based de novo
design) program to generate a focused library of potential inhibitors. A
molecular scaffold related to a previously identified compound was selected and
led to a novel series of compounds. Ten out of nineteen derivatives showed 50-75%
inhibition on the purified recombinant protein at 200 μM and among them three
derivatives (12, 13 and 18) exhibited Ki in the sub-millimolar range (0.84, 2.4
and 0.58 mM, respectively). Despite their only modest potency, the cN-II
inhibitors showed synergistic effects when used in combination with cytotoxic
purine nucleoside analogues on cancer cells. Therefore, these derivatives
represent a family of non-nucleos(t)idic cN-II inhibitors with potential
usefulness to overcome cancer drug resistance especially in hematological
malignancies in which cN-II activity has been described as an important
parameter.

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 require that
pharmacogenetic genotyping methods need to be established according to technical 
standards and laboratory practice guidelines before testing can be offered to
patients. Testing methods for variants in ABCB1, CBR3, COMT, CYP3A7, C8ORF34,
FCGR2A, FCGR3A, HAS3, NT5C2, NUDT15, SBF2, SEMA3C, SLC16A5, SLC28A3, SOD2, TLR4, 
and TPMT were validated in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments-accredited laboratory. Because no known reference materials were
available, DNA samples that were from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ) were
used for the analytical validation studies. Pharmacogenetic testing methods
developed here were shown to be accurate and 100% analytically sensitive and
specific. Other Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-accredited
laboratories interested in offering pharmacogenetic testing for these genetic
variants, related to genotype-guided therapy for oncology, could use these
publicly available samples as reference materials when developing and validating 
new genetic tests or refining current assays.

Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability. Previous 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrated that some single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly associated with autism, while other
studies focusing on these GWAS hits showed inconsistent results. Besides, the
association between these variants and autism in the Chinese Han population
remains unclear. Therefore, this family-based association study was performed in 
640 Chinese Han autism trios to investigate the association between autism and 7 
SNPs with genome-wide significance in previous GWAS (rs4307059 near MSNP1AS,
rs4141463 in MACROD2, rs2535629 in ITIH3, rs11191454 in AS3MT, rs1625579 in
MIR137HG, rs11191580 in NT5C2, and rs1409313 in CUEDC2). The results showed a
nominal association between the T allele of rs4307059 and autism under both
additive model (T>C, Z = 2.250, P = .024) and recessive model (T>C, Z = 2.109,
P = .035). The findings provided evidence that rs4307059 near MSNP1AS might be a 
susceptibility variant for autism in the Chinese Han population.

Comorbidity, a co-incidence of several disorders in an individual, is a common
phenomenon. Their development is governed by multiple factors, including genetic 
variation. The current study was set up to look at associations between isolated 
and comorbid diseases of bronchial asthma and hypertension, on one hand, and
single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with regulation of gene expression
(eQTL), on the other hand. A total of 96 eQTL SNPs were genotyped in 587 Russian 
individuals. Bronchial asthma alone was found to be associated with rs1927914
(TLR4), rs1928298 (intergenic variant), and rs1980616 (SERPINA1); hypertension
alone was found to be associated with rs11065987 (intergenic variant); rs2284033 
(IL2RB), rs11191582 (NT5C2), and rs11669386 (CARD8); comorbidity between asthma
and hypertension was found to be associated with rs1010461 (ANG/RNASE4),
rs7038716, rs7026297 (LOC105376244), rs7025144 (intergenic variant), and
rs2022318 (intergenic variant). The results suggest that genetic background of
comorbidity of asthma and hypertension is different from genetic backgrounds of
both diseases manifesting isolated.

The growing evidence of the involvement of purine compounds in signaling, of
nucleotide imbalance in tumorigenesis, the discovery of purinosome and its
regulation, cast new light on purine metabolism, indicating that well known
biochemical pathways may still surprise. Adenosine deaminase is important not
only to preserve functionality of immune system but also to ensure a correct
development and function of central nervous system, probably because its activity
regulates the extracellular concentration of adenosine and therefore its function
in brain. A lot of work has been done on extracellular 5'-nucleotidase and its
involvement in the purinergic signaling, but also intracellular nucleotidases,
which regulate the purine nucleotide homeostasis, play unexpected roles, not only
in tumorigenesis but also in brain function. Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase (HPRT) appears to have a role in the purinosome formation and,
therefore, in the regulation of purine synthesis rate during cell cycle with
implications in brain development and tumors. The final product of purine
catabolism, uric acid, also plays a recently highlighted novel role. In this
review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological
manifestations of purine dysmetabolisms, focusing on the newly
described/hypothesized roles of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II, adenosine kinase,
adenosine deaminase, HPRT, and xanthine oxidase.

Purine metabolism is depending on a large amount of enzymes to ensure cellular
homeostasis. Among these enzymes, we have been interested in the 5'-nucleotidase 
cN-II and its role in cancer biology and in response of cancer cells to
treatments. This protein has been cited and studied in a large number of papers
published during the last decade for its involvement in non-cancerous pathologies
such as hereditary spastic paraplegia, schizophrenia, and blood pressure
regulation. Here, we review these articles in order to give an overview of the
recently discovered clinical relevance of cN-II.

Aberrant splicing is a hallmark of leukemias with mutations in splicing factor
(SF)-encoding genes. Here we investigated its prevalence in pediatric B-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL), where SFs are not mutated. By comparing
these samples to normal pro-B cells, we found thousands of aberrant local splice 
variations (LSVs) per sample, with 279 LSVs in 241 genes present in every
comparison. These genes were enriched in RNA processing pathways and encoded ∼100
SFs, e.g. hnRNPA1. HNRNPA1 3'UTR was most pervasively mis-spliced, yielding the
transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. To mimic this event, we knocked it
down in B-lymphoblastoid cells and identified 213 hnRNPA1-regulated exon usage
events comprising the hnRNPA1 splicing signature in pediatric leukemia. Some of
its elements were LSVs in DICER1 and NT5C2, known cancer drivers. We searched for
LSVs in other leukemia and lymphoma drivers and discovered 81 LSVs in 41
additional genes. Seventy-seven LSVs out of 81 were confirmed using two large
independent B-ALL RNA-seq datasets, and the twenty most common B-ALL drivers,
including NT5C2, showed higher prevalence of aberrant splicing than of somatic
mutations. Thus, post-transcriptional deregulation of SF can drive widespread
changes in B-ALL splicing and likely contributes to disease pathogenesis.

Circular RNA circ-NT5C2 acts as a potential novel biomarker for prognosis of
osteosarcoma.

OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important 
roles in multiple diseases, including cancer. Circ-NT5C2 was reported to be
up-regulated in osteosarcoma. However, the clinical significance of circ-NT5C2
remains largely unclear. The aim of the current study was to investigate the
value of circ-NT5C2 for the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: the expression of circ-NT5C2 in osteosarcoma tissues and
corresponding normal tissues were explored by quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments. The association of circ-NT5C2 expression
with clinicopathological factors or the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients was
also analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to analyze the
association of circ-NT5C2 expression with overall survival (OS) and disease-free 
survival (DFS) of patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses
were used to identify risk factors for poor prognosis.
RESULTS: Our data showed a significant increase of circ-NT5C2 expression in
osteosarcoma tissues compared with adjacent normal bone tissues (p < 0.01). In
addition, we found that the level of circ-NT5C2 in osteosarcoma was strongly
correlated with clinical stage (p = 0.006) and distant metastasis (p = 0.001).
Importantly, patients with high expression of circ-NT5C2 had a shorter OS (p =
0.006) and DFS (p = 0.001) than those with low expression of circ-NT5C2. Finally,
Cox regression analyses showed that high circ-NT5C2 expression might be an
independent prognostic parameter to predict poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that circ-NT5C2 is significantly up-regulated
in osteosarcoma tissues. Circ-NT5C2 may represent a new marker of prognosis in
osteosarcoma.

criticized as a risk factor in cardiovascular disease. Selective breeding
programs could be used to alter the fatty acid (FA) composition of bovine milk to
improve the healthiness of dairy products for human consumption. Here, we
performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on bovine milk to identify
genomic regions or specific genes associated with FA profile and to investigate
genetic differences between the Italian Simmental (IS) and Italian Holstein (IH) 
breeds. To achieve this, we first characterized milk samples from 416 IS cows and
436 IH cows for their fat profile by gas chromatography. Subjects were genotyped 
with single nucleotide polymorphism array and a single-marker regression model
for GWAS was performed. Our findings confirm previously reported quantitative
trait loci strongly associated with bovine milk fat composition. More
specifically, our GWAS results revealed significant signals on chromosomes Bos
taurus autosome 19 and 26 for milk FA. Further analysis using a gene-centric
approach and pathway meta-analysis identified not only some well-known genes
underlying quantitative trait loci for milk FA components, such as FASN, SCD, and
DGAT1, but also other significant candidate genes, including some with functional
roles in pathways related to "Lipid metabolism." Highlighted genes related to FA 
profile include ECI2, PCYT2, DCXR, G6PC3, PYCR1, and ALG12 in IS, and CYP17A1,
ACO2, PI4K2A, GOT1, GPT, NT5C2, PDE6G, POLR3H, and COX15 in IH. Overall, the
breed-specific association outcomes reflect differences in the genetic
backgrounds of the IS and IH breeds and their selective breeding histories.

The antileukaemic drug 6-mercaptopurine is converted into thioguanine nucleotides
(TGN) and incorporated into DNA (DNA-TG), the active end metabolite. In a series 
of genome-wide association studies, we analysed time-weighted means (wm) of
erythrocyte concentrations of TGN (Ery-TGN) and DNA-TG in 1009 patients
undergoing maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In
discovery analyses (454 patients), the propensity for DNA-TG incorporation
(wmDNA-TG/wmEry-TGN ratio) was significantly associated with three intronic SNPs 
in NT5C2 (top hit: rs72846714; P = 2.09 × 10-10, minor allele frequency 15%). In 
validation analyses (555 patients), this association remained significant during 
both early and late maintenance therapy (P = 8.4 × 10-6 and 1.3 × 10-3,
respectively). The association was mostly driven by differences in wmEry-TGN, but
in regression analyses adjusted for wmEry-TGN (P < 0.0001), rs72846714-A genotype
was also associated with a higher wmDNA-TG (P = 0.029). Targeted sequencing of
NT5C2 did not identify any missense variants associated with rs72846714 or
wmEry-TGN/wmDNA-TG. rs72846714 was not associated with relapse risk, but in a
separate cohort of 180 children with relapsed ALL, rs72846714-A genotype was
associated with increased occurrence of relapse-specific NT5C2 gain-of-function
mutations that reduce cytosol TGN levels (P = 0.03). These observations highlight
the impact of both germline and acquired mutations in drug metabolism and disease
trajectory.

Purine homeostasis is maintained by a purine cycle in which the regulated member 
is a cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) hydrolyzing IMP and GMP. Its expression
is particularly high in proliferating cells, indeed high cN-II activity or
expression in hematological malignancy has been associated to poor prognosis and 
chemoresistance. Therefore, a strong interest has grown in developing cN-II
inhibitors, as potential drugs alone or in combination with other compounds. As a
model to study the effect of cN-II inhibition we utilized a lung carcinoma cell
line (A549) in which the enzyme was partially silenced and its low activity
conformation was stabilized through incubation with 2-deoxyglucose. We measured
nucleotide content, reduced glutathione, activities of enzymes involved in
glycolysis and Krebs cycle, protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, cellular
proliferation, migration and viability. Our results demonstrate that high cN-II
expression is associated with a glycolytic, highly proliferating phenotype, while
silencing causes a reduction of proliferation, protein synthesis and migration
ability, and an increase of oxidative performances. Similar results were obtained
in a human astrocytoma cell line. Moreover, we demonstrate that cN-II silencing
is concomitant with p53 phosphorylation, suggesting a possible involvement of
this pathway in mediating some of cN-II roles in cancer cell biology.

BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure is an important risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and is also an important factor in global mortality.
Military pilots are at high risk of cardiovascular disease because they undergo
persistent noise, high mental tension, high altitude hypoxia, high acceleration
and high calorie diet. Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular
disease in military pilots. In this study, we want to identify key genes from
peripheral blood cells of military pilots with hypertension. Identification of
these genes may help diagnose and control hypertension and extend flight career
for military pilots.
METHODS: We use RNA sequencing technology, bioinformatics analysis and Western
blotting to identify key genes from peripheral blood cells of military pilots
with hypertension.
RESULTS: Our study detected 121 up-regulated genes and 623 down-regulated genes
in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hypertensive military
pilots. We have also identified 8 important genes (NME4, PNPLA7, GGT5, PTGS2,
IGF1R, NT5C2, ENTPD1 and PTEN), a number of gene ontology categories and
biological pathways that may be associated with military pilot hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study may provide effective means for the prevention, diagnosis 
and treatment of hypertension for military pilot and extend their flight career.

Activating mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene NT5C2 drive
resistance to 6-mercaptopurine in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we
demonstrate that constitutively active NT5C2 mutations K359Q and L375F
reconfigure the catalytic center for substrate access and catalysis in the
absence of allosteric activator. In contrast, most relapse-associated mutations, 
which involve the arm segment and residues along the surface of the
inter-monomeric cavity, disrupt a built-in switch-off mechanism responsible for
turning off NT5C2. In addition, we show that the C-terminal acidic tail lost in
the Q523X mutation functions to restrain NT5C2 activation. These results uncover 
dynamic mechanisms of enzyme regulation targeted by chemotherapy
resistance-driving NT5C2 mutations, with important implications for the
development of NT5C2 inhibitor therapies.

Retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic target the t(15;17)(q24;q21) PML/RARA driver of
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), their combination now curing over 95%
patients. We report exome sequencing of 64 matched samples collected from
patients at initial diagnosis, during remission, and following relapse after
historical combined RA-chemotherapy treatments. A first subgroup presents a high 
incidence of additional oncogenic mutations disrupting key epigenetic or
transcriptional regulators (primarily WT1) or activating MAPK signaling at
diagnosis. Relapses retain these cooperating oncogenes and exhibit additional
oncogenic alterations and/or mutations impeding therapy response (RARA, NT5C2).
The second group primarily exhibits FLT3 activation at diagnosis, which is lost
upon relapse together with most other passenger mutations, implying that
these relapses derive from ancestral pre-leukemic PML/RARA-expressing cells that 
survived RA/chemotherapy. Accordingly, clonogenic activity of
PML/RARA-immortalized progenitors ex vivo is only transiently affected by RA, but
selectively abrogated by arsenic. Our studies stress the role of cooperating
oncogenes in direct relapses and suggest that targeting pre-leukemic cells by
arsenic contributes to its clinical efficacy.

Activating mutations in NT5C2, a gene encoding cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase
(cN-II), confer chemoresistance in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we
show that all mutants became independent of allosteric effects of ATP and thus
constitutively active. Structural mapping of mutations described in patients
demonstrates that 90% of leukemia-specific allelles directly affect two
regulatory hotspots within the cN-II molecule-the helix A region: residues
355-365, and the intersubunit interface: helix B (232-242) and flexible
interhelical loop L (400-418). Furthermore, analysis of hetero-oligomeric
complexes combining wild-type (WT) and mutant subunits showed that the activation
is transmitted from the mutated to the WT subunit. This intersubunit interaction 
forms structural basis of hyperactive NT5C2 in drug-resistant leukemia in which
heterozygous NT5C2 mutation gave rise to hetero-tetramer mutant and WT proteins. 
This enabled us to define criteria to aid the prediction of NT5C2 drug resistance
mutations in leukemia.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of endogenous noncoding RNA which have been
verified to participate in numerous pathophysiological processes. However, the
underlying role of circRNAs in osteosarcoma tissue is still unidentified. Our
study aims to investigate the circRNA expression profiles in osteosarcoma tissue 
and investigate the physiological functions of circRNAs. Human circRNAs
microarray analysis showed that 785 differently expressed circRNAs were
distinguished in osteosarcoma tissue and adjacent non-tumor tissue with 2 fold
change. Circ-NT5C2 was validated to be up-regulated expressed in 52 pairs of
osteosarcoma tissue and cell lines. Furthermore, the enforced expression of
circ-NT5C2 could act as a valuable diagnostic marker for osteosarcoma detection
with AUC (area under the ROC curve) value of 0.753. Functional validation
experiments verified that circ-NT5C2 silencing suppressed the proliferation and
invasion, and promoted apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. In vivo,
circ-NT5C2 silencing inhibited the tumor growth. Bioinformatics analysis and
rescue experiments indicated that circ-NT5C2 sponged miR-448, which was confirmed
by luciferase reporter assay and RT-PCR assay. Overall, our study investigates
the circRNAs expression profiles and determines the function of circ-NT5C2 in
osteosarcoma tumorigenesis, which might serve as a novel therapeutic target of
osteosarcoma patients.

Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is associated with resistance to
chemotherapy and poor prognosis. Gain-of-function mutations in the
5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic II (NT5C2) gene induce resistance to 6-mercaptopurine 
and are selectively present in relapsed ALL. Yet, the mechanisms involved in
NT5C2 mutation-driven clonal evolution during the initiation of leukaemia,
disease progression and relapse remain unknown. Here we use a
conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of
NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance 
to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell
growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity. The loss-of-fitness phenotype of
NT5C2+/R367Q mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the
extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool.
Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of
inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity
against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts. These results identify the fitness
cost of NT5C2 mutation and resistance to chemotherapy as key evolutionary drivers
that shape clonal evolution in relapsed ALL and support a role for IMPDH
inhibition in the treatment of ALL.

A growing number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated
with body mass index (BMI) and obesity, but whether the effects of these
obesity-susceptibility loci are uniform across the BMI distribution remains
unclear. We studied the effects of 37 BMI-associated SNPs in 75,230 adults of
European ancestry across BMI percentiles by using conditional quantile regression
(CQR) and meta-regression (MR) models. The effects of nine SNPs (24%)-rs1421085
(FTO; p = 8.69 × 10-15), rs6235 (PCSK1; p = 7.11 × 10-6), rs7903146 (TCF7L2; p = 
9.60 × 10-6), rs11873305 (MC4R; p = 5.08 × 10-5), rs12617233 (FANCL; p = 5.30 ×
10-5), rs11672660 (GIPR; p = 1.64 × 10-4), rs997295 (MAP2K5; p = 3.25 × 10-4),
rs6499653 (FTO; p = 6.23 × 10-4), and rs3824755 (NT5C2; p = 7.90 ×
10-4)-increased significantly across the sample BMI distribution. We showed that 
such increases stemmed from unadjusted gene interactions that enhanced the
effects of SNPs in persons with a high BMI. When 125 height-associated SNPs were 
analyzed for comparison, only one (<1%), rs6219 (IGF1, p = 1.80 × 10-4), showed
effects that varied significantly across height percentiles. Cumulative gene
scores of these SNPs (GS-BMI and GS-height) showed that only GS-BMI had effects
that increased significantly across the sample distribution (BMI: p = 7.03 ×
10-37; height: p = 0.499). Overall, these findings underscore the importance of
gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in shaping the genetic architecture
of BMI and advance a method for detecting such interactions by using only the
sample outcome distribution.

BACKGROUND: Gene polymorphisms at microRNA-binding sites (poly-miRTS) may affect 
gene transcription and expression through miRNA regulation, which is associated
with cancer susceptibility, sensitivity to chemotherapy and prognosis. This study
investigated the association between poly-miRTS of Ara-C/anthracycline metabolic 
pathways genes and the outcome of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Chinese
patients after Ara-C-based chemotherapy.
METHODS: A total of 17 poly-miRTS were selected from the SNPinfo Web Server and
genotyped in 206 Chinese Han non-FAB-M3 AML patients using the SEQUENOM
Mass-ARRAY system.
RESULTS: Among these 17 poly-miRTS, five Ara-C metabolic gene single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs, NT5C2 rs10786736 and rs8139, SLC29A1 rs3734703, DCTD rs7278,
and RRM1 rs1042919) were identified to significantly associate with complete AML 
remission and/or overall and relapse-free survival (OS and RFS, respectively),
and four anthracycline-metabolic gene SNPs (ABCC1 rs3743527, rs212091, and
rs212090 and CBR1 rs9024) were significantly associated with chemotherapy-related
toxicities. Moreover, SLC29A1 rs3734703 was shown to associate with both
chemotherapy response and survival (adjusted OR 2.561 in the overdominant model; 
adjusted HR 2.876 for OS and 2.357 for RFS in the dominant model).
CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study demonstrated that the poly-miRTS of 
Ara-C/anthracyclines metabolic genes predicted the sensitivity and side effects
of AML to Ara-C-based chemotherapy and patient survival. Further study will
confirm them as biomarkers for AML patients after Ara-C-based chemotherapy.

Hereditary spastic paraplegias are a rare group of clinically and genetically
heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases, with upper motor neuron degeneration
and progressive lower limb spasticity as their main phenotypic features. Despite 
that 76 distinct loci have been reported and some casual genes identified, most
of the underlying causes still remain unidentified. Moreover, a wide range of
clinical manifestations is present in most hereditary spastic paraplegias
subtypes, adding further complexity to their differential clinical diagnoses.
Here, we describe the first exon rearrangement reported in the SPG45/SPG65
(NT5C2) loci in a family featuring a complex hereditary spastic paraplegias
phenotype. This study expands both the phenotypic and mutational spectra of the
NT5C2-associated disease.

SPG45 is a rare form of autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia associated with
mental retardation. Detailed phenotyping and mutation analysis was undertaken in 
three individuals with SPG45 from a consanguineous family of Arab Muslim origin. 
Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation 
in NT5C2 (c.1379T>C; p.Leu460Pro). Our data expand the molecular basis of SPG45, 
adding the first missense mutation to the current database of nonsense,
frameshift, and splice site mutations. NT5C2 mutations seem to have a broad
clinical spectrum and should be sought in patients manifesting either as
uncomplicated or complicated HSP.

Cytarabine is considered the most effective chemotherapeutic option in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). The impact of 10 polymorphisms in cytarabine metabolic
pathway genes were evaluated in 225 adult de novo AML patients. Variant alleles
of DCK rs2306744 and CDA rs602950 showed higher complete remission (p = .024,
p = .045), with lower survival rates for variant alleles of CDA rs2072671
(p = .015, p = .045, p = .032), rs3215400 (p = .033) and wild-type genotype of
rs602950 (p = .039, .014). Induction death (p = .033) and lower survival rates
(p = .021, p = .047) were correlated to RRM1 rs9937 variant allele. In addition, 
variant alleles of CDA rs532545 and rs602950 were related to skin toxicity
(p = .031, p = .049) and mucositis to DCK rs2306744 minor allele (p = .046).
Other toxicities associated to variant alleles were hepatotoxicity to NT5C2
rs11598702 (p = .032), lung toxicity (p = .031) and thrombocytopenia to DCK
rs4694362 (p = .046). This study supports the interest of cytarabine pathway
polymorphisms regarding efficacy and toxicity of AML therapy in a coherent
integrated manner.

Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.

AIM: Mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) is an extra hepatic hepatitis C virus related
problem and different studies suggested genetics' role in predicting this
complication. We evaluated the influence of SNPs in IL-28B, SLC29A1, SLC28A2,
NT5C2, HNF4 and ABCB1 genes in MC prediction.
PATIENTS & METHODS: SNPs were evaluated through real-time PCR.
RESULTS:  ABCB1 (gene encoding P-glycoprotein) 3435C>T SNP was associated with MC
presence (p = 0.034): related to T allele carriers (CC vs CT/TT), we reached a
p-value of 0.013. In the logistic regression analysis baseline viral load
>600.000 IU/ml (p < 001), IL28B rs8099917/rs12979860 TT/CC (p < 0.001), NT5 (gene
encoding for 5' nucleotidase) 153 TC (p = 0.012) and ABCB1 3435 CT/TT (p = 0.034)
genotypes predicted MC presence.
CONCLUSION: These data could help clinicians to identify patients with higher
probability to show MC extra hepatic complication.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the expression level of PRPS1
and the clinical characteristics in children with acute leukemia(AL).
METHODS: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the
level of PRPS1 mRNA and protein expression in bone marrow samples from 176
patients diagnosed as AL (126 cases were newly diagnosed and 50 cases in complete
remission), and its relevance with clinical indicators was statistically
analyzed. The bone marrow samples from 21 children with non-malignant
hematological disease were used as controls.
RESULTS: (1)In B-ALL group, the level of PRPS1 mRNA in newly diagnosed patients
were significantly higher than that in control and than that in complete
remission patients (both P<0.0001). In T-ALL and AML group, differences was only 
observed between newly diagnosed patients and complete remission patients(both
P<0.0001); (2)In B-ALL group, the expression level of PRPS1 increase with along
risk enhancement (P<0.01), while no significant difference was observed in T-ALL 
(P>0.05). In AML patients, expression difference was shown between low risk group
and high risk group(P<0.05); (3)High PRPS1 mRNA expression level were associated 
with high WBC counts and MRD positive in B-ALL patients (P=0.020, P=0.026,
respectively); (4)Expression of NT5C2, an essential gene for relapse and drug
resistance, was found to be positively correlated with PRPS1 expression in AL
samples(P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: High expression of PRPS1 is relevant factor of unfavourable prognosis
in B-ALL children, which suggest PRPS1 may be a new indicator for prognosis of
pediatric B-ALL and an index to guide individualized chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide single marker and gene-based meta-analyses of long-term
average (LTA) blood pressure (BP) phenotypes may reveal novel findings for BP.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted genome-wide analysis among 18 422 East Asian
participants (stage 1) followed by replication study of ≤46 629 participants of
European ancestry (stage 2). Significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms and
genes were determined by a P<5.0×10-8 and 2.5×10-6, respectively, in joint
analyses of stage-1 and stage-2 data. We identified 1 novel ARL3 variant,
rs4919669 at 10q24.32, influencing LTA systolic BP (stage-1 P=5.03×10-8, stage-2 
P=8.64×10-3, joint P=2.63×10-8) and mean arterial pressure (stage-1 P=3.59×10-9, 
stage-2 P=2.35×10-2, joint P=2.64×10-8). Three previously reported BP loci
(WBP1L, NT5C2, and ATP2B1) were also identified for all BP phenotypes. Gene-based
analysis provided the first robust evidence for association of KCNJ11 with LTA
systolic BP (stage-1 P=8.55×10-6, stage-2 P=1.62×10-5, joint P=3.28×10-9) and
mean arterial pressure (stage-1 P=9.19×10-7, stage-2 P=9.69×10-5, joint
P=2.15×10-9) phenotypes. Fourteen genes (TMEM180, ACTR1A, SUFU, ARL3, SFXN2,
WBP1L, CYP17A1, C10orf32, C10orf32-ASMT, AS3MT, CNNM2, and NT5C2 at 10q24.32;
ATP2B1 at 12q21.33; and NCR3LG1 at 11p15.1) implicated by previous genome-wide
association study meta-analyses were also identified. Among the loci identified
by the previous genome-wide association study meta-analysis of LTA BP, we
transethnically replicated associations of the KCNK3 marker rs1275988 at 2p23.3
with LTA systolic BP and mean arterial pressure phenotypes (P=1.27×10-4 and
3.30×10-4, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 1 novel variant and 1 novel gene and present the first
direct evidence of relevance of the KCNK3 locus for LTA BP among East Asians.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a genetically heterogeneous
group of neurodegenerative diseases. Thin Corpus Callosum (TCC) associated HSP is
a distinguished subgroup of complex forms. Purines and pyrimidine, the basic DNA 
and RNA components, are regulating the cell metabolism, having roles in signal
transduction, energy preservation and cellular repair. Genetic defects in
nucleotide metabolism related genes have been only recently implicated in brain
and neurodegenerative diseases' pathogenesis.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a consanguineous Qatari family with two brothers, 9
and 3 years, who displayed a characteristic phenotype of early onset and
markedly-severe spasticity with tiptoe walking, delayed dysarthric speech,
persistent truncal hypotonia, and multiple variable-sized areas of brownish skin 
discoloration appearing at different places on the body. A clinical diagnosis
suggestive of complex hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) was set after the
family had the second affected child. Whole genome sequencing identified a novel 
homozygous NT5C2 splice site mutation (NM_012229.4/NM_001134373.2:
c.1159 + 1G > T) that recessively segregated in family members. Brain MRI
revealed dysgenic and thin corpus callosum (TCC) with peri-trigonal white matter 
cystic changes in both affected boys, whereas a well-developed corpus callosum
with normal white matter was shown in their apparently normal brother, who found 
to be a carrier for the mutant variant. This mutation led to skipping of exon 14 
with removal of 58 amino acid residues at the C-terminal half. The aberrantly
spliced NT5C2 showed substantial reduction in expression level in the in-vitro
study, indicating marked instability of the mutant NT5C2 protein.
CONCLUSION: The present report expands the phenotypic spectrum of SPG45 and
confirms NT5C2-SPG45 as a member of the rare TCC SPG-subtypes. Homozygous
alteration in NT5C2 seems essential to produce central white matter developmental
defects. The study highlights the importance of cytosolic II 5'-nucleotidase
(NT5C2) in maintaining the normal balance of purines' pool in the brain, which
seems to play a pivotal role in the normal development of central white matter
structures.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in energy homeostasis and is
activated in response to contraction-induced ATP depletion in skeletal muscle via
a rise in intracellular AMP/ADP concentrations. AMP can be deaminated by
AMP-deaminase (AMPD) to IMP, which is hydrolyzed to inosine by cytosolic
5'-nucleotidase II (NT5C2). AMP can also be hydrolyzed to adenosine by cytosolic 
5'-nucleotidase 1A (NT5C1A). Previous gene silencing and overexpression studies
indicated control of AMPK activation by NT5C enzymes. In the present study using 
gene knockout mouse models, we investigated the effects of NT5C1A and NT5C2
deletion on intracellular adenine nucleotide levels and AMPK activation in
electrically stimulated skeletal muscles. Surprisingly, NT5C enzyme knockout did 
not lead to enhanced AMP or ADP concentrations in response to contraction, with
no potentiation of increases in AMPK activity in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) 
and soleus mouse muscles. Moreover, dual blockade of AMP metabolism in EDL using 
an AMPD inhibitor combined with NT5C1A deletion did not enhance rises in AMP and 
ADP or increased AMPK activation by electrical stimulation. The results on
muscles from the NT5C knockout mice contradict previous findings where AMP levels
and AMPK activity were shown to be modulated by NT5C enzymes.

4-pirydone-3-carboxamide-1β-d-ribonucleoside (4PYR) is an endogenous nucleoside
that could be converted to triphosphates, diphosphates, monophosphates and an
analogue of NAD - 4PYRAD. Elevated level of these compounds have been reported in
chronic renal failure, cancer and active HIV infection. However, little is known 
about the effect on cell functionality and the metabolic pathways. This study
tested effects of 4PYR in different cell types on nucleotide, energy metabolism
and clarified enzymes that are involved in conversions of 4PYR. We have found
that human neuroblastoma cells, human malignant melanoma cells, human
adipose-derived stem cells, human bone marrow-derived stem cells, human dermal
microvascular endothelial cells and human embryonic kidney cells, were capable to
convert 4PYR into its derivatives. This was associated with deterioration of
cellular energetics. Incubation with 4PYR did not affect mitochondrial function, 
but decreased glycolytic rate (as measured by extracellular acidification) in
endothelial cells. Silencing of adenosine kinase, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II
and nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 3, blocked metabolism of 4PYR.
Incubation of endothelial cells with 4PYR decreased AMP deaminase activity by
40%. The main finding of this paper is that human cells (including cancer type)
are capable of metabolizing 4PYR that lead to deterioration of energy metabolism,
possibly as the consequence of inhibition of glycolysis. This study, it was also 
found that several enzymes of nucleotide metabolism could also contribute to the 
4PYRconversions.

Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of deaths of
childhood cancer. Although relapse usually happens in the bone marrow,
extramedullary relapse occasionally occurs including either the central nervous
system or testis (<1-2%). We selected two pediatric ALL patients who experienced 
testicular relapse and interrogated their leukemic cells with exome sequencing.
The sequencing results and clonality analyses suggest that relapse of patient
D483 directly evolved from the leukemic clone at diagnosis which survived
chemotherapy. In contrast, relapse leukemia cells (both bone marrow and testis)
of patient D727 were likely derived from a common ancestral clone, and testicular
relapse likely arose independently from the bone marrow relapsed leukemia. Our
findings decipher the mutational spectra and shed light on the clonal evolution
of two cases of pediatric ALL with testicular relapse. Presence of CREBBP/NT5C2
mutations suggests that a personalized therapeutic approach should be applied to 
these two patients.

In the search for genes that define critical steps of relapse in pediatric T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and can serve as prognostic markers, we
performed targeted sequencing of 313 leukemia-related genes in 214 patients: 67
samples collected at the time of relapse and 147 at initial diagnosis. As
relapse-specific genetic events, we identified activating mutations in NT5C2
(P=0.0001, Fisher's exact test), inactivation of TP53 (P=0.0007, Fisher's exact
test) and duplication of chr17:q11.2-24.3 (P=0.0068, Fisher's exact test) in
32/67 of T-ALL relapse samples. Alterations of TP53 were frequently homozygous
events, which significantly correlated with higher rates of copy number
alterations in other genes compared with wild-type TP53 (P=0.0004, Mann-Whitney's
test). We subsequently focused on mutations with prognostic impact and identified
genes governing DNA integrity (TP53, n=8; USP7, n=4; MSH6, n=4), having key roles
in the RAS signaling pathway (KRAS, NRAS, n=8), as well as IL7R (n=4) and CNOT3
(n=4) to be exclusively mutated in fatal relapses. These markers recognize 24/49 
patients with a second event. In 17 of these patients with mostly refractory
relapse and dire need for efficient treatment, we identified candidate targets
for personalized therapy with p53 reactivating compounds, MEK inhibitors or
JAK/STAT-inhibitors that may be incorporated in future treatment strategies.

A genetic component influences the development of atherosclerosis in the general 
population and also in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, genetic polymorphisms 
associated with atherosclerosis in the general population are not always involved
in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in RA. Accordingly, a study in
North-American RA patients did not show the association reported in the general
population of coronary artery disease with a series of relevant polymorphisms
(TCF21, LPA, HHIPL1, RASD1-PEMT, MRPS6, CYP17A1-CNNM2-NT5C2, SMG6-SRR, PHACTR1,
WDR12 and COL4A1-COL4A2). In the present study, we assessed the potential
association of these polymorphisms with CVD in Southern European RA patients. We 
also assessed if polymorphisms implicated in the increased risk of subclinical
atherosclerosis in non-rheumatic Caucasians (ZHX2, PINX1, SLC17A4, LRIG1 and
LDLR) may influence the risk for CVD in RA. 2,609 Spanish patients were genotyped
by TaqMan assays. Subclinical atherosclerosis was determined in 1,258 of them by 
carotid ultrasonography (assessment of carotid intima media thickness and
presence/absence of carotid plaques). No statistically significant differences
were found when each polymorphism was assessed according to the presence/absence 
of cardiovascular events and subclinical atherosclerosis, after adjustment for
potential confounder factors. Our results do not show an association between
these 15 polymorphisms and atherosclerosis in RA.

Objective:: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a significant 
relationship between the NT5C2 variant rs11191580 and schizophrenia (SCZ) in
European populations. This study aimed to validate the association of rs11191580 
polymorphism with SCZ risk in a South Chinese Han population. The relationship of
this polymorphism with the severity of SCZ clinical symptoms was also explored.
Methods:: A case-control study was performed in 462 patients with SCZ and 598
healthy controls. Rs11191580 was genotyped by the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX
platform. A total of 459 SCZ patients completed the Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) evaluation. Data were analyzed by PLINK software.
Results:: We confirmed an association of the rs11191580 polymorphism with SCZ
risk in South Chinese Han under a dominant genetic model (ORadj = 0.769; 95%CIadj
= 0.600-0.984; padj = 0.037). PANSS scores showed a significant association
between variant rs11191580 and total score (padj = 0.032), lack of response scale
score (padj = 0.022), and negative scale score (additive: padj = 0.004; dominant:
padj = 0.016; recessive: padj = 0.021) after data were adjusted for age and sex.
Conclusion:: NT5C2 variant rs11191580 conferred susceptibility to SCZ and
affected the clinical symptoms of SCZ in a South Chinese Han population.

OBJECTIVES: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified
numerous putative genetic polymorphisms associated with bipolar disorder (BD)
and/or schizophrenia (SC). We hypothesized that a portion of these polymorphisms 
would also be associated with BD in the Latino American population. To identify
such regions, we tested previously identified genetic variants associated with BD
and/or SC and ancestral haploblocks containing these single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of Latino subjects with BD.
METHODS: A total of 2254 Latino individuals were genotyped for 91 SNPs identified
in previous BD and/or SC GWASs, along with selected SNPs in strong linkage
disequilibrium with these markers. Family-based single marker and haplotype
association testing was performed using the PBAT software package. Empirical
P-values were derived from 10 000 permutations.
RESULTS: Associations of eight a priori GWAS SNPs with BD were replicated with
nominal (P≤.05) levels of significance. These included SNPs within nuclear factor
I A (NFIA), serologically defined colon cancer antigen 8 (SDCCAG8), lysosomal
associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3), nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1), 
major histocompatibility complex, class I, B (HLA-B) and 5'-nucleotidase,
cytosolic II (NT5C2) and SNPs within intragenic regions microRNA 6828
(MIR6828)-solute carrier family 7 member 14 (SLC7A14) and sonic hedgehog
(SHH)-long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1006 (LINC01006). Of the 76
ancestral haploblocks that were tested for associations with BD, our top
associated haploblock was located in LAMP3; however, the association did not meet
statistical thresholds of significance following Bonferroni correction.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that some of the gene variants found to be
associated with BD or SC in other populations are also associated with BD risk in
Latinos. Variants in six genes and two intragenic regions were associated with BD
in our Latino sample and provide additional evidence for overlap in genetic risk 
between SC and BD.

BACKGROUND: Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the main causes
of mortality in childhood malignancies. Previous genetic studies demonstrated
that chemoresistant ALL is driven by activating mutations in NT5C2, the gene
encoding cytosolic 5´-nucleotidase (cN-II). However, molecular mechanisms
underlying this hyperactivation are still unknown. Here, we present kinetic and
structural properties of cN-II variants that represent 75 % of mutated alleles in
patients who experience relapsed ALL (R367Q, R238W and L375F).
RESULTS: Enzyme kinetics measurements revealed that the mutants are consitutively
active without need for allosteric activators. This shows that hyperactivity is
not caused by a direct catalytic effect but rather by misregulation of cN-II.
X-ray crystallography combined with mass spectrometry-based techniques
demonstrated that this misregulation is driven by structural modulation of the
oligomeric interface within the cN-II homotetrameric assembly. These specific
conformational changes are shared between the studied variants, despite the
relatively random spatial distribution of the mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings define a common molecular mechanism for cN-II
hyperactivity, which provides a solid basis for targeted therapy of leukemia. Our
study highlights the cN-II oligomerization interface as an attractive
pharmacological target.

BACKGROUND: Nelarabine has been used for the treatment of T-cell malignancies
including T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)/T-lymphoblastic lymphoma.
However, the mechanisms that underlie the susceptibility or resistance to
nelarabine have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine
the significance of nelarabine transport and metabolism in the context of
nelarabine cytotoxicity.
PROCEDURE: The expression profiles of six genes in the nelarabine pathway were
analyzed in blast cells from six patients with T-ALL as well as in three T-ALL
cell lines. In vitro cytotoxicity (LC50 of 9-β-d-arabinofuranosylguanine [ara-G])
was evaluated.
RESULTS: The mRNA expression of ENT1, DCK, CDA, NT5C2, RRM1, and RRM2 in patients
showed inter-individual variability and was not correlated with the LC50 of
ara-G. However, the ratio of (ENT1 × DCK)/(CDA × RRM1) expression was
significantly correlated with LC50 (r = -0.831, P = 0.0405).
CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensitivity to nelarabine is influenced by the balance of the
expression of these four genes, and the ratio of their expression predicts the
response of T-cell malignancies to nelarabine.

A series of seventeen β-hydroxyphosphonate ribonucleoside analogues containing
4-substituted-1,2,3-triazoles was synthesized and fully characterized. Such
compounds were designed as potential inhibitors of the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 
II (cN-II), an enzyme involved in the regulation of purine nucleotide pools. NMR 
and molecular modelling studies showed that a few derivatives adopted similar
structural features to IMP or GMP. Five derivatives were identified as modest
inhibitors with 53 to 64% of cN-II inhibition at 1 mM.

Despite the identification of numerous schizophrenia-associated genetic variants,
few have been examined functionally to identify and characterize the causal
variants. To mitigate this, we aimed at identifying functional variants affecting
miRNA function. Using data from a large-scale genome-wide association study of
schizophrenia, we looked for schizophrenia risk variants altering either miRNA
binding sites, miRNA genes, promoters for miRNA genes, or variants that were
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for miRNA genes. We hereby identified 
several potentially functional variants relating to miRNA function with our top
finding being a schizophrenia protective allele that disrupts miR-206׳s binding
to NT5C2 thus leading to increased expression of this gene. A subsequent
experimental follow-up of the variant using a luciferase-based reporter assay
confirmed that the allele disrupts the binding. Our study therefore suggests that
miR-206 may contribute to schizophrenia risk through allele-dependent regulation 
of the genome-wide significant gene NT5C2.

Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric condition with high heritability.
Replicating the specific genetic variants that increase susceptibility to
schizophrenia in different populations is critical to better understand
schizophrenia. CNNM2 and NT5C2 are genes recently identified as susceptibility
genes for schizophrenia in Europeans, but the exact mechanism by which these
genes confer risk for schizophrenia remains unknown. In this study, we examined
the potential for genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia of a three-gene cluster
region, AS3MT-CNNM2-NT5C2. We implemented a two-stage strategy to conduct
association analyses of the targeted regions with schizophrenia. A total of 8218 
individuals were recruited, and 45 pre-selected single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were genotyped. Both single-marker and haplotype-based analyses were
conducted in addition to imputation analysis to increase the coverage of our
genetic markers. Two SNPs, rs11191419 (OR=1.24, P=7.28×10(-5)) and rs11191514
(OR=1.24, P=0.0003), with significant independent effects were identified. These 
results were supported by the data from both the discovery and validation stages.
Further haplotype and imputation analyses also validated these results, and
bioinformatics analyses indicated that CALHM1, which is located approximately
630kb away from CNNM2, might be a susceptible gene for schizophrenia. Our results
provide further support that AS3MT, CNNM2 and CALHM1 are involved with the
etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia, suggesting these genes are potential 
targets of interest for the improvement of disease management and the development
of novel pharmacological strategies.

Chromosome 10q24.32-q24.33 is one of the most robustly supported risk loci to
emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia. However,
extensive linkage disequilibrium makes it difficult to distinguish the actual
susceptibility gene(s) at the locus, limiting its value for improving biological 
understanding of the condition. In the absence of coding changes that can account
for the association, risk is likely conferred by altered regulation of one or
more genes in the region. We, therefore, used highly sensitive measures of
allele-specific expression to assess cis-regulatory effects associated with the
two best-supported schizophrenia risk variants (SNP rs11191419 and indel
ch10_104957618_I/rs202213518) on the primary positional candidates BORCS7, AS3MT,
CNNM2, and NT5C2 in the human brain. Heterozygosity at rs11191419 was associated 
with increased allelic expression of BORCS7 and AS3MT in the fetal and adult
brain, and with reduced allelic expression of NT5C2 in the adult brain.
Heterozygosity at ch10_104957618_I was associated with reduced allelic expression
of NT5C2 in both the fetal and adult brain. Comparisons between cDNA ratios in
heterozygotes and homozygotes for the risk alleles indicated that cis-effects on 
NT5C2 expression in the adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could be largely
accounted for by genotype at these two risk variants. While not excluding effects
on other genes in the region, this study implicates altered neural expression of 
BORCS7, AS3MT, and NT5C2 in susceptibility to schizophrenia arising from genetic 
variation at the chromosome 10q24 locus. © 2016 The Authors. American Journal of

OBJECTIVE: Observational studies have shown a positive association between
obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m2) and depression. Around 120
obesity-associated loci have been identified, but genetic variants associated
with depression remain elusive. Recently, our team reported that the fat mass and
obesity-associated (FTO) gene rs9939609 obesity-risk variant is paradoxically
inversely associated with the risk of depression. This finding raises the
question as to whether other obesity-associated genetic variants are also
associated with depression.
METHOD: Twenty-one obesity gene variants other than FTO were selected from a
custom ∼50,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyping array
(ITMAT-Broad-CARe array). Associations of these 21 SNPs and an unweighted
genotype score with BMI and major depressive disorder (determined using the
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) were tested in 3,209 cases and 14,195 noncases, using
baseline data collected from July 2001 to August 2003 from the multiethnic
EpiDREAM study.
RESULTS: Body mass index was positively associated with depression status (odds
ratio [OR] = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03 per BMI unit; P = 2.9 × 10(-12), adjusted
for age, sex, and ethnicity). Six of 21 genetic variants (rs1514176 [TNN13K],
rs2206734 [CDKAL1], rs11671664 [GIPR], rs2984618 [TAL1], rs3824755 [NT5C2], and
rs7903146 [TCF7L2]) and the genotype score were significantly associated with BMI
(1.47 × 10(-14) ≤ P ≤ .04). Of the 21 SNPs, TAL1 rs2984618 obesity-risk allele
was associated with a higher risk of major depressive disorder (P = 1.79 ×
10(-4), adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity), and BDNF rs1401635
demonstrated significant ethnic-dependent association with major depressive
disorder (OR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.97; P = .01 in non-Europeans and OR = 1.11;
95% CI, 1.02-1.20; P = .02 in Europeans; Pinteraction = 2.73 × 10(-4)). The
genotype score, calculated with or without FTO rs9939609, and adjusted for the
same covariates, was not associated with depression status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the view that the association between obesity and
major depressive disorder at the observational level may be explained, at least
in part, by shared genetic factors.

We used a combined approach based on fragment-based drug design (FBDD) and in
silico methods to design potential inhibitors of the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II
(cN-II), which has been recognized as an important therapeutic target in
hematological cancers. Two subgroups of small compounds (including adenine and
biaryl moieties) were identified as cN-II binders and a fragment growing strategy
guided by molecular docking was considered. Five compounds induced a strong
inhibition of the 5'-nucleotidase activity in vitro, and the most potent ones
were characterized as noncompetitive inhibitors. Biological evaluation in cancer 
cell lines showed synergic effect with selected anticancer drugs. Structural
studies using X-ray crystallography lead to the identification of new binding
sites for two derivatives and of a new crystal form showing important domain
swapping. Altogether, the strategy developed herein allowed identifying new
original noncompetitive inhibitors against cN-II that act in a synergistic manner
with well-known antitumoral agents.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression level and analyze the clinical
significance of NT5C2, which is an nucleoside analogues metabolism related gene, 
in children with acute leukemia (AL).
METHODS: Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were presented to detect the
level of NT5C2 mRNA and its protein product cN- Ⅱ in bone marrow samples of 63
patients initially diagnosed with AL, 15 patients who achieved complete
remission, 7 patients who relapsed and 16 non- hematologic malignancie controls. 
The expression of NT5C2 mRNA in different groups of AL and its relevance with
clinical indicators were analyzed.
RESULTS: ①The expression of NT5C2 mRNA in newly diagnosed B-ALL, TALL, AML and
controls were 1.16 (0.89-2.25, 0.96 (0.74-1.25, 1.66 (0.84-3.15) and 0.88
(0.61-1.21), respectively. NT5C2 mRNA expression in AML (P<0.01) and B-ALL
(P<0.05) cases were higher than that in controls; NT5C2 mRNA expression in T- ALL
and in controls showed no significant difference (P>0.05). Changes of NT5C2 mRNA 
level were observed between preliminary diagnosis and complete remission in 15
patients. NT5C2 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in complete remission
stage than that in newly diagnosis AL (P<0.01). NT5C2 mRNA levels of
relapsed-refractory group were higher than that of complete remission group and
controls (P<0.01). ② Immunohistochemical staining results revealed that NT5C2
protein levels were consistent with the trend of mRNA levels. ③NT5C2 mRNA levels 
in AML (r=0.434) and T-ALL (r=0.389) were positively correlated with risk
classification (P<0.05). ④ During chemotherapy of patients with AML, the NR rate 
of bone marrow in NT5C2 high expression group was higher than that of low
expression group after 9 days induction chemotherapy (35.2% vs 0) and before
consolidation therapy (25.0% vs 0); The positive rate of minimal-residual disease
(36.4% vs 14.3%) and relapse rate of AL (38.5% vs 28.6%) were increased in NT5C2 
high expressed patients than that in low expressed patients, but all the
differences were insignificant (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: High expression of NT5C2 was found to be a related risk factor of AL 
children with unfavourable prognosis. NT5C2 promises a new target for guiding
individualized chemotherapy and evaluating the prognosis of childhood acute
leukemia and monitoring recurrence.

    Haematologica. 2015 Nov;100(11):1373-5.

Relapsed precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is characterized by
resistance against chemotherapy and is frequently fatal. We aimed at
understanding the molecular mechanisms resulting in relapse of T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia and analyzed 13 patients at first diagnosis, remission and
relapse by whole exome sequencing, targeted ultra-deep sequencing, multiplex
ligation dependent probe amplification and DNA methylation array. Compared to
primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in relapse the number of single
nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions approximately doubled from
11.5 to 26. Targeted ultra-deep sequencing sensitively detected subclones that
were selected for in relapse. The mutational pattern defined two types of
relapses. While both are characterized by selection of subclones and acquisition 
of novel mutations, 'type 1' relapse derives from the primary leukemia whereas
'type 2' relapse originates from a common pre-leukemic ancestor. Relapse-specific
changes included activation of the nucleotidase NT5C2 resulting in resistance to 
chemotherapy and mutations of epigenetic modulators, exemplified by SUZ12, WHSC1 
and SMARCA4. While mutations present in primary leukemia and in relapse were
enriched for known drivers of leukemia, relapse-specific changes revealed an
association with general cancer-promoting mechanisms. This study thus identifies 
mechanisms that drive progression of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia to relapse and may explain the characteristic treatment resistance of
this condition.

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) has been reported to be involved in cell
survival, nucleotide metabolism and in the cellular response to anticancer drugs.
With the aim to further evaluate the role of this enzyme in cell biology, we
stably modulated its expression the human glioblastoma cell ADF in which the
transient inhibition of cN-II has been shown to induce cell death. Stable cell
lines were obtained both with inhibition, obtained with plasmids coding
cN-II-targeting short hairpin RNA, and stimulation, obtained with plasmids coding
Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)-fused wild type cN-II or a GFP-fused hyperactive
mutant (GFP-cN-II-R367Q), of cN-II expression. Silenced cells displayed a
decreased proliferation rate while the over expressing cell lines displayed an
increased proliferation rate as evidenced by impedance measurement using the
xCELLigence device. The expression of nucleotide metabolism relevant genes was
only slightly different between cell lines, suggesting a compensatory mechanism
in transfected cells. Cells with decreased cN-II expression were resistant to the
nucleoside analog fludarabine confirming the involvement of cN-II in the
metabolism of this drug. Finally, we observed sensitivity to cisplatin in cN-II
silenced cells and resistance to this same drug in cN-II over-expressing cells
indicating an involvement of cN-II in the mechanism of action of platinum
derivatives, and most probably in DNA repair. In summary, our findings confirm
some previous data on the role of cN-II in the sensitivity of cancer cells to
cancer drugs, and suggest its involvement in other cellular phenomenon such as
cell proliferation.

IMP/GMP preferring cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) is a bifunctional enzyme 
whose activities and expression play crucial roles in nucleotide pool
maintenance, nucleotide-dependent pathways and programmed cell death. Alignment
of primary amino acid sequences of cN-II from human and other organisms show a
strong conservation throughout the entire vertebrata taxon suggesting a
fundamental role in eukaryotic cells. With the aim to investigate the potential
role of this homology in protein-protein interactions, a two hybrid system
screening of cN-II interactors was performed in S. cerevisiae. Among the X
positive hits, the Leucin Rich Repeat (LRR) domain of Ipaf was found to interact 
with cN-II. Recombinant Ipaf isoform B (lacking the Nucleotide Binding Domain)
was used in an in vitro affinity chromatography assay confirming the interaction 
obtained in the screening. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation with proteins from
wild type Human Embryonic Kidney 293 T cells demonstrated that endogenous cN-II
co-immunoprecipitated both with wild type Ipaf and its LRR domain after
transfection with corresponding expression vectors, but not with Ipaf lacking the
LRR domain. These results suggest that the interaction takes place through the
LRR domain of Ipaf. In addition, a proximity ligation assay was performed in A549
lung carcinoma cells and in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and showed a positive 
cytosolic signal, confirming that this interaction occurs in human cells. This is
the first report of a protein-protein interaction involving cN-II, suggesting
either novel functions or an additional level of regulation of this complex
enzyme.

There is incomplete understanding of genetic heterogeneity and clonal evolution
during cancer progression. Here we use deep whole-exome sequencing to describe
the clonal architecture and evolution of 20 pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic
leukaemias from diagnosis to relapse. We show that clonal diversity is comparable
at diagnosis and relapse and clonal survival from diagnosis to relapse is not
associated with mutation burden. Six pathways were frequently mutated, with
NT5C2, CREBBP, WHSC1, TP53, USH2A, NRAS and IKZF1 mutations enriched at relapse. 
Half of the leukaemias had multiple subclonal mutations in a pathway or gene at
diagnosis, but mostly with only one, usually minor clone, surviving therapy to
acquire additional mutations and become the relapse founder clone.
Relapse-specific mutations in NT5C2 were found in nine cases, with mutations in
four cases being in descendants of the relapse founder clone. These results
provide important insights into the genetic basis of treatment failure in ALL and
have implications for the early detection of mutations driving relapse.

Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.

Our understanding of the genetic basis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) has been greatly advanced by genomic profiling and sequencing studies.
These efforts have characterized the genetic basis of recently described and
poorly understood subtypes of ALL, including early T-cell precursor ALL,
Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL, and ALL with intrachromosomal
amplification of chromosome 21, and have identified several rational therapeutic 
targets in high-risk ALL, notably ABL1-class and JAK-STAT inhibitors in Ph-like
ALL. Deep sequencing studies are also refining our understanding of the genetic
basis of clonal heterogeneity and relapse. These studies have elucidated the
nature of clonal evolution during disease progression and identified genetic
changes that confer resistance to specific therapeutic agents, including CREBBP
and NT5C2. Genomic profiling has also identified common and rare inherited
genetic variants that influence the risk of developing leukemia. These efforts
are now being extended to ALL in adolescents and adults with the goal of fully
defining the genetic landscape of ALL to further improve treatment outcomes in
high-risk populations.

Ribavirin is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase 1 (AK1) and cytosolic
5'-nucleotidase 2 and it is transported into cells by concentrative nucleoside
transporters (CNT) 2/3, coded by SLC28A2/3 genes, and equilibrative nucleoside
transporters (ENT) 1/2, coded by SLC29A1/2 genes. We evaluated the association of
some polymorphisms of IL28B, SLC28A2/3, SLC29A1, ABCB1, NT5C2, AK1, HNF4α genes
and ribavirin treatment outcome and pharmacokinetics after 4weeks of therapy, in 
a cohort of HCV-1/4 Italian patients. Allelic discrimination was performed by
real-time PCR; plasma concentrations were determined at the end of dosing
interval (Ctrough) using an HPLC-UV method. Non response was negatively predicted
by cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype and positively by Metavir
score; Metavir score, insulin resistance and SLC28A2_rs1060896 CA/AA and
HNF4α_rs1884613 CC genotypes were negative predictive factors of SVR, whereas HCV
viral load at baseline and IL28B_rs12980275 AA and rs8099917 TT genotypes
positively predicted this outcome; RVR was negatively predicted by insulin
resistance and positively by cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype;
Metavir score and insulin resistance were able to negatively predict EVR, whereas
cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype positively predicted it; at
last, virological relapse was negatively predicted by IL28B_rs8099917 TT and
AK1_rs1109374 TT genotypes, insulin resistance was a positive predictor factor.
Concerning ribavirin pharmacokinetics, SLC28A2_rs11854488 TT was related to lower
Ctrough levels; conversely patients with TC profile of SLC28A3_rs10868138 and
SLC29A1_rs760370 GG genotype had higher ribavirin levels. These results might
contribute to the clarification of mechanisms causing the individuality in the
response to ribavirin containing therapy.

For several years the IMP/GMP-preferring cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) has
been considered as a therapeutic target in oncology. Indeed, various reports have
indicated associations between cN-II expression level and resistance to
anticancer agents in several cancer cell lines and in patients affected with
neoplasia, mainly by hematologic malignancies. In this paper we present evidence 
showing that, among the commonly used cytotoxic nucleoside analogs, fludarabine
can act as a cN-II inhibitor. In vitro studies using the wild type recombinant
cN-II demonstrated that fludarabine inhibited enzymatic activity in a mixed
manner (Ki 0.5 mM and Ki' 9 mM), whereas no inhibition was observed with
clofarabine and cladribine. Additional experiments with mutant recombinant
proteins and an in silico molecular docking indicated that this inhibition is due
to an interaction with a regulatory site of cN-II known to interact with adenylic
compounds. Moreover, synergy experiments between fludarabine and 6-mercaptopurine
in human follicular lymphoma (RL) and human acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) 
cells transfected with control or cN-II-targeting shRNA-encoding plasmids, showed
synergy in control cells and antagonism in cells with decreased cN-II expression.
This is in line with the hypothesis that fludarabine acts as a cN-II inhibitor
and supports the idea of using cN-II inhibitors in association with other drugs
to increase their therapeutic effect and decrease their resistance.

Update on biology and treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Patrick K(1), Vora A.

Author information:

Sheffield, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, new insights into the clinical and biological
features of paediatric T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and their
impact on treatment outcome have been described.
RECENT FINDINGS: T-lineage ALL has considerable phenotypic and biological
heterogeneity. Compared with B-lineage ALL, the prognostic significance of the
presenting white cell count is weaker and the rate of decline in minimal residual
disease is slower in patients with T-lineage ALL. Contemporary, response
stratified, treatment protocols incorporating dexamethasone have been associated 
with significant improvements in outcomes and demonstrated that cranial
radiotherapy is not essential for preventing central nervous system relapse.
Relapse risk remains higher than for B-lineage ALL and outcome after relapse is
poor. Early T-precursor phenotype and genetic abnormalities such as activating
ABL1 fusions, NOTCH1/FBXW7, and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene mutations
identify patient groups who may benefit from alternative treatment. New agents
such as nelarabine, bortezomib, and clofarabine may be effective in preventing
unsalvageable relapses identified by slow response to first-line therapy.
SUMMARY: Around 85% of children and young people with T-lineage ALL are cured by 
current therapy. Further improvements in outcome can be expected from genetic
profile and response-targeted therapeutics.

Major neuropsychiatric disorders are highly heritable, with mounting evidence
suggesting that these disorders share overlapping sets of molecular and cellular 
underpinnings. In the current article we systematically test the degree of
genetic commonality across six major neuropsychiatric disorders-attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders (Anx), autistic spectrum
disorders (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and
schizophrenia (SCZ). We curated a well-vetted list of genes based on large-scale 
human genetic studies based on the NHGRI catalog of published genome-wide
association studies (GWAS). A total of 180 genes were accepted into the analysis 
on the basis of low but liberal GWAS p-values (<10(-5)). 22% of genes overlapped 
two or more disorders. The most widely shared subset of genes-common to five of
six disorders-included ANK3, AS3MT, CACNA1C, CACNB2, CNNM2, CSMD1, DPCR1, ITIH3, 
NT5C2, PPP1R11, SYNE1, TCF4, TENM4, TRIM26, and ZNRD1. Using a suite of
neuroinformatic resources, we showed that many of the shared genes are implicated
in the postsynaptic density (PSD), expressed in immune tissues and co-expressed
in developing human brain. Using a translational cross-species approach, we
detected two distinct genetic components that were both shared by each of the six
disorders; the 1st component is involved in CNS development, neural projections
and synaptic transmission, while the 2nd is implicated in various cytoplasmic
organelles and cellular processes. Combined, these genetic components account for
20-30% of the genetic load. The remaining risk is conferred by distinct,
disorder-specific variants. Our systematic comparative analysis of shared and
unique genetic factors highlights key gene sets and molecular processes that may 
ultimately translate into improved diagnosis and treatment of these debilitating 
disorders.

Elevated blood pressure: Our family's fault? The genetics of essential
hypertension.

AIM: To provide an updated review on current genetic aspects possibly affecting
essential hypertension (EH), and to further elucidate their role in EH.
METHODS: We searched for genetic and epigenetic factors in major studies
associated with EH between Jan 2008-Oct 2013 using PubMed. We limited our search 
to reviews that discussed mostly human studies, and were accessible through the
university online resource. We found 11 genome wide association studies (GWAS),
as well as five methylation and three miRNA studies that fit our search criteria.
A distinction was not made between genes with protective effects or negative
effects, as this article is only meant to be a summary of genes associated with
any aspect of EH.
RESULTS: We found 130 genes from the studies that met our inclusion/exclusion
criteria. Of note, genes with multiple study references include: STK39, CYP17A1, 
MTHFR-NPPA, MTHFR-NPPB, ATP2B1, CSK, ZNF652, UMOD, CACNB2, PLEKHA7, SH2B3,
TBX3-TBX5, ULK4, CSK-ULK3, CYP1A2, NT5C2, CYP171A, PLCD3, SH2B3, ATXN2, CACNB2,
PLEKHA7, SH2B3, TBX3-TBX5, ULK4, and HFE. The following genes overlapped between 
the genetic studies and epigenetic studies: WNK4 and BDKRB2. Several of the
identified genes were found to have functions associated with EH. Many epigenetic
factors were also correlated with EH. Of the epigenetic factors, there were no
articles discussing siRNA and its effects on EH that met the search criteria,
thus the topic was not included in this review. Among the miRNA targets found to 
be associated with EH, many of the genes involved were also identified in the
GWAS studies.
CONCLUSION: Genetic hypertension risk algorithms could be developed in the future
but may be of limited benefit due to the multi-factorial nature of EH. With
emerging technologies, like next-generation sequencing, more direct causal
relationships between genetic and epigenetic factors affecting EH will likely be 
discovered creating a tremendous potential for personalized medicine using
pharmacogenomics.

Recent genetic association studies have identified 55 genetic loci associated
with obesity or body mass index (BMI). The vast majority, 51 loci, however, were 
identified in European-ancestry populations. We conducted a meta-analysis of
associations between BMI and ∼2.5 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide 
polymorphisms among 86 757 individuals of Asian ancestry, followed by in silico
and de novo replication among 7488-47 352 additional Asian-ancestry individuals. 
We identified four novel BMI-associated loci near the KCNQ1 (rs2237892, P = 9.29 
× 10(-13)), ALDH2/MYL2 (rs671, P = 3.40 × 10(-11); rs12229654, P = 4.56 ×
10(-9)), ITIH4 (rs2535633, P = 1.77 × 10(-10)) and NT5C2 (rs11191580, P = 3.83 × 
10(-8)) genes. The association of BMI with rs2237892, rs671 and rs12229654 was
significantly stronger among men than among women. Of the 51 BMI-associated loci 
initially identified in European-ancestry populations, we confirmed eight loci at
the genome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) and an additional 14 at P <
1.0 × 10(-3) with the same direction of effect as reported previously. Findings
from this analysis expand our knowledge of the genetic basis of obesity.

The cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) has been proposed as an attractive
molecular target for the development of novel drugs circumventing resistance to
cytotoxic nucleoside analogues currently used for treating leukemia and other
malignant hemopathies. In the present work, synthesis of β-hydroxyphosphonate
nucleoside analogues incorporating modifications either on the sugar residue or
the nucleobase, and their in vitro evaluation towards the purified enzyme were
carried out in order to determine their potency towards the inhibition of cN-II. 
In addition to the biochemical investigations, molecular modeling studies
revealed important structural features for binding affinities towards the target 
enzyme.

BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine is used for the treatment of several solid tumours and
exhibits high inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. In this study, we
explore possible predictive covariates on drug and metabolite disposition.
METHODS: Forty patients were enrolled. Gemcitabine and dFdU concentrations in the
plasma and dFdCTP concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cell were
measured to 72 h post infusion, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by 
nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Patient-specific covariates were tested in
model development.
RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine was best described by a
two-compartment model with body surface area, age and NT5C2 genotype as
significant covariates. The pharmacokinetics of dFdU and dFdCTP were adequately
described by three-compartment models. Creatinine clearance and cytidine
deaminase genotype were significant covariates for dFdU pharmacokinetics. Rate of
infusion of <25 mg m(-2) min(-1) and the presence of homozygous major allele for 
SLC28A3 (CC genotype) were each associated with an almost two-fold increase in
the formation clearance of dFdCTP.
CONCLUSION: Prolonged dFdCTP systemic exposures (≥72 h) were commonly observed.
Infusion rate <25 mg m(-2) min(-1) and carriers for SLC28A3 variant were each
associated with about two-fold higher dFdCTP formation clearance. The impacts of 
these covariates on treatment-related toxicity in more selected patient
populations (that is, first-line treatment, single disease state and so on) are
not yet clear.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic stroke (IS) and coronary artery disease (CAD)
share several risk factors and each has a substantial heritability. We conducted 
a genome-wide analysis to evaluate the extent of shared genetic determination of 
the two diseases.
METHODS: Genome-wide association data were obtained from the METASTROKE, Coronary
Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAM), and
Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics consortia. We first analyzed common
variants reaching a nominal threshold of significance (P<0.01) for CAD for their 
association with IS and vice versa. We then examined specific overlap across
phenotypes for variants that reached a high threshold of significance. Finally,
we conducted a joint meta-analysis on the combined phenotype of IS or CAD.
Corresponding analyses were performed restricted to the 2167 individuals with the
ischemic large artery stroke (LAS) subtype.
RESULTS: Common variants associated with CAD at P<0.01 were associated with a
significant excess risk for IS and for LAS and vice versa. Among the 42 known
genome-wide significant loci for CAD, 3 and 5 loci were significantly associated 
with IS and LAS, respectively. In the joint meta-analyses, 15 loci passed
genome-wide significance (P<5×10(-8)) for the combined phenotype of IS or CAD and
17 loci passed genome-wide significance for LAS or CAD. Because these loci had
prior evidence for genome-wide significance for CAD, we specifically analyzed the
respective signals for IS and LAS and found evidence for association at
chr12q24/SH2B3 (PIS=1.62×10(-7)) and ABO (PIS=2.6×10(-4)), as well as at HDAC9
(PLAS=2.32×10(-12)), 9p21 (PLAS=3.70×10(-6)), RAI1-PEMT-RASD1 (PLAS=2.69×10(-5)),
EDNRA (PLAS=7.29×10(-4)), and CYP17A1-CNNM2-NT5C2 (PLAS=4.9×10(-4)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate substantial overlap in the genetic risk of
IS and particularly the LAS subtype with CAD.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide significant associations of schizophrenia with eight SNPs
in the CNNM2, MIR137, PCGEM1, TRIM26, CSMD1, MMP16, NT5C2 and CCDC68 genes have
been identified in a recent mega-analysis of genome-wide association studies. To 
date, the role of these SNPs on gray matter (GM) volumes remains unclear.
METHODS: After performing quality control for minor-allele frequency > 5% using a
JPT HapMap sample and our sample, a genotyping call rate > 95% and Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium testing (p > 0.01), five of eight SNPs were eligible for analysis. We
used a comprehensive voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technique to investigate the
effects of these five SNPs on GM volumes between major-allele homozygotes and
minor-allele carriers in Japanese patients with schizophrenia (n = 173) and
healthy subjects (n = 449).
RESULTS: The rs7914558 risk variant at CNNM2 was associated with voxel-based GM
volumes in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri (right T = 4.96, p = 0.0088, left 
T = 4.66, p = 0.031). These peak voxels, which were affected by the variant,
existed in the orbital region of the inferior frontal gyri. Individuals with the 
risk G/G genotype of rs7914558 had smaller GM volumes in the bilateral inferior
frontal gyri than carriers of the non-risk A-allele. Although several effects of 
the genotype and the genotype-diagnosis interaction of other SNPs on GM volumes
were observed in the exploratory VBM analyses, these effects did not remain after
the FWE-correction for multiple tests (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the genetic variant in the CNNM2 gene
could be implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia through the GM
volumetric vulnerability of the orbital regions in the inferior frontal gyri.

A native electrophoretic technique to study oligomerization and activity of
cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II.

Filoni DN, Pesi R, Allegrini S, Camici M, Tozzi MG.

The analysis of the oligomeric active state of a native protein usually requires 
the application of at least two analytical methods such as gel filtration and
analytical ultracentrifugation. Both methods require a substantial amount of
protein, time and/or expensive equipment. We here describe a native
electrophoretic method for the identification of the native molecular weight of
the recombinant wild-type cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase (cN-II) and of its mutants in
subunit interfaces Y115A, F36R, K311A and G319Q. The protein was stained both
with protein dye and with an activity staining method. Our results demonstrated
that purified recombinant protein preparations contained substantial amounts of
nucleic acids and misfolded, inactive protein. Furthermore, cN-II mutants K311A
and G319Q in subunit interface assume a quaternary dimeric active form, while the
only active quaternary structure of wild-type cN-II is the tetramer.

We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of mean arterial
pressure and pulse pressure among 26,600 East Asian participants (stage 1)
followed by replication study of up to 28,783 participants (stage 2). For novel
loci, statistical significance was determined by a P<5.0×10(-8) in joint analysis
of stage 1 and stage 2 data. For loci reported by the previous mean arterial and 
pulse pressure genome-wide association study meta-analysis in Europeans, evidence
of transethnic replication was determined by consistency in effect direction and 
a Bonferroni-corrected P<1.4×10(-3). No novel loci were identified by the current
study. Five independent mean arterial pressure variants demonstrated robust
evidence for transethnic replication including rs17249754 at ATP2B1
(P=7.5×10(-15)), rs2681492 at ATP2B1 (P=3.4×10(-7)), rs11191593 at NT5C2
(1.1×10(-6)), rs3824755 at CYP17A1 (P=1.2×10(-6)), and rs13149993 at FGF5
(P=2.4×10(-4)). Two additional variants showed suggestive evidence of transethnic
replication (consistency in effect direction and P<0.05), including rs319690 at
MAP4 (P=0.014) and rs1173771 at NPR3 (P=0.018). For pulse pressure, robust
evidence of replication was identified for 2 independent variants, including
rs17249754 at ATP2B1 (P=1.2×10(-5)) and rs11191593 at NT5C2 (P=1.1×10(-3)), with 
suggestive evidence of replication among an additional 2 variants including
rs3824755 at CYP17A1 (P=6.1×10(-3)) and rs2681492 at ATP2B1 (P=9.0×10(-3)).
Replicated variants demonstrated consistency in effect sizes between East Asian
and European samples, with effect size differences ranging from 0.03 to 0.24
mm Hg for mean arterial pressure and from 0.03 to 0.21 mm Hg for pulse pressure. 
In conclusion, we present the first evidence of transethnic replication of
several mean arterial and pulse pressure loci in an East Asian population.

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) is an intracellular 5'-nucleotidase
characterized by substrate specificity. It preferentially hydrolyzes
6-hydroxypurine nucleotides such as IMP and GMP over AMP or UMP. cN-II is
allosterically activated by ATP and inhibited by inorganic phosphate. It also has
phosphotransferase activity and transfers phosphate moieties from IMP or GMP to
nonphysiological nucleoside analogues used to treat some viral infections or
malignancies. The cN-II gene has a strikingly conserved primary structure from
humans to nematodes and its activity has been detected in various animals
including snails. Its activity is highest in the livers of birds, crocodiles,
lizards and snakes. The activity in chicken liver increases 2-fold by feeding a
high-protein diet. These results suggest that cN-II participates, through IMP
dephosphorylation, in production of uric acid as the main end product of
aminonitrogen in these animals. Some studies suggest that cN-II participates in
dephosphorylation of IMP accumulated in cells of some tissues to diffusible
inosine for reutilization by other tissues. It has also been proposed that cN-II,
together with purine nucleoside phosphorylase and hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase, constitutes the "oxypurine cycle", thus regulating
intracellular phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) concentrations. As for
intracellular dephosphorylation of AMP, another intracellular 5'-nucleotidase,
cN-I, is supposed to participate, because it hydrolyzes AMP more preferentially
than IMP or GMP. However, for the tissues, in which the expression of cN-I is
very low or undetectable, e.g. liver or brain tissues, results have been obtained
that suggest the participation of cN-II in intracellular dephosphorylation of
AMP.

Among the members of the 5'-nucleotidase family, there is only one membrane-bound
ectosolic isoenzyme. This esterase prefers AMP as substrate but can hydrolyze a
number of purine and pyrimidine phosphorylated compounds, indicating that no
evolutive pressure to develop a more restricted specificity was exerted on this
enzyme. On the contrary, five cytosolic isoforms have been evolved, probably by
convergent evolution, showing different and restricted substrate specificity. The
different isoforms have different level of expression and distribution in organs 
of vertebrates. The cytosolic nucleotidase specific for IMP and GMP (cN-II), is
an enzyme allosterically regulated, structurally strongly conserved and expressed
at a low but constant level in all organs and tissues in vertebrates. As far as
we know, alteration of cN-II expression is limited to pathological conditions. In
this review, we report the results of the modulation of cN-II specific activity
exerted by silencing or hyperexpression in different cell types, in the attempt
to better understand its role and implications in pathology and therapy.

IMPORTANCE: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a devastating psychiatric condition.
Identifying the specific genetic variants and pathways that increase
susceptibility to SCZ is critical to improve disease understanding and address
the urgent need for new drug targets.
OBJECTIVE: To identify SCZ susceptibility genes.
DESIGN: We integrated results from a meta-analysis of 18 genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) involving 1,085,772 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 6
databases that showed significant informativeness for SCZ. The 9380 most
promising SNPs were then specifically genotyped in an independent family-based
replication study that, after quality control, consisted of 8107 SNPs.
SETTING: Linkage meta-analysis, brain transcriptome meta-analysis, candidate gene
database, OMIM, relevant mouse studies, and expression quantitative trait locus
databases.
PATIENTS: We included 11,185 cases and 10,768 control subjects from 6 databases
and, after quality control 6298 individuals (including 3286 cases) from 1811
nuclear families.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Case-control status for SCZ.
RESULTS: Replication results showed a highly significant enrichment of SNPs with 
small P values. Of the SNPs with replication values of P.01, the proportion of
SNPs that had the same direction of effects as in the GWAS meta-analysis was 89% 
in the combined ancestry group (sign test, P < 2.20 x 10(-16) and 93% in subjects
of European ancestry only (P < 2.20 < 10(-16)). Our results supported the major
histocompatibility complex region showing a3.7-fold overall enrichment of
replication values of P < .01 in subjects from European ancestry. We replicated
SNPs in TCF4 (P = 2.53 x 10(-10)) and NOTCH4 (P = 3.16 x 10(-7)) that are among
the most robust SCZ findings. More novel findings included POM121L2 (P = 3.51 x
10(-7)), AS3MT (P = 9.01 x 10(-7)), CNNM2 (P = 6.07 = 10(-7)), and NT5C2(P = 4.09
x 10(-7)). To explore the many small effects, we performed pathway analyses. The 
most significant pathways involved neuronal function (axonal guidance, neuronal
systems, and L1 cell adhesion molecule interaction)and the immune system (antigen
processing, cell adhesion molecules relevant to T cells, and translocation to
immunological synapse).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We replicated novel SCZ disease genes and pathogenic
pathways. Better understanding the molecular and biological mechanisms involved
with schizophrenia may improve disease management and may identify new drug
targets.

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II is a widespread IMP hydrolyzing enzyme, essential
for cell vitality, whose role in nucleotide metabolism and cell function is still
to be exactly determined. Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase overexpression and silencing 
have both been demonstrated to be toxic for mammalian cultured cells. In order to
ascertain the effect of enzyme expression on a well-known eukaryote simple model,
we expressed cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which
normally hydrolyzes IMP through the action of a nucleotidase with distinct
functional and structural features. Heterologous expression was successful. The
yeast cells harbouring cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II displayed a shorter
duplication time and a significant modification of purine and pyrimidine
derivatives concentration as compared with the control strain. Furthermore the
capacity of homologous recombination in the presence of mutagenic compounds of
yeast expressing cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II was markedly impaired.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting
from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive
chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL
do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy,
making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge
in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify
mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a
5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of
nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and
1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased
nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with
6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These
results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased 
nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance
in ALL.

Relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carries a poor prognosis,
despite intensive retreatment, owing to intrinsic drug resistance. The biological
pathways that mediate resistance are unknown. Here, we report the transcriptome
profiles of matched diagnosis and relapse bone marrow specimens from ten
individuals with pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia using RNA sequencing.
Transcriptome sequencing identified 20 newly acquired, novel nonsynonymous
mutations not present at initial diagnosis, with 2 individuals harboring
relapse-specific mutations in the same gene, NT5C2, encoding a 5'-nucleotidase.
Full-exon sequencing of NT5C2 was completed in 61 further relapse specimens,
identifying additional mutations in 5 cases. Enzymatic analysis of mutant
proteins showed that base substitutions conferred increased enzymatic activity
and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies. Clinically, all
individuals who harbored NT5C2 mutations relapsed early, within 36 months of
initial diagnosis (P = 0.03). These results suggest that mutations in NT5C2 are
associated with the outgrowth of drug-resistant clones in ALL.

Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

Arsenic is a very potent toxicant. One major susceptibility factor for
arsenic-related toxicity is the efficiency of arsenic metabolism. The efficiency,
in turn, is associated with non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
the arsenic methyltransferase AS3MT on chromosome 10q24. However, the mechanism
of action for these SNPs is not yet clarified. Here, we assessed the influence of
genetic variation in AS3MT on DNA methylation and gene expression within 10q24,
in people exposed to arsenic in drinking water. DNA was extracted from peripheral
blood from women in the Argentinean Andes (N = 103) and from cord blood from
new-borns in Bangladesh (N = 127). AS3MT SNPs were analyzed with Sequenom or
Taqman assays. Whole genome epigenetic analysis with Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip was performed on bisulphite-treated DNA. Whole genome gene expression
analysis was performed with Illumina DirectHyb HumanHT-12 v4.0 on RNA from
peripheral blood. Arsenic exposure was assessed by HPLC-ICPMS. In the Argentinean
women, the major AS3MT haplotype, associated with more efficient arsenic
metabolism, showed increased methylation of AS3MT (p = 10(-6)) and also
differential methylation of several other genes within about 800 kilobasepairs:
CNNM2 (p<10(-16)), NT5C2 (p<10(-16)), C10orf26 (p = 10(-8)), USMG5 (p = 10(-5)), 
TRIM8 (p = 10(-4)), and CALHM2 (p = 0.038) (adjusted for multiple comparisons).
Similar, but weaker, associations between AS3MT haplotype and DNA methylation in 
10q24 were observed in cord blood (Bangladesh). The haplotype-associated altered 
CpG methylation was correlated with reduced expression of AS3MT and CNNM2
(r(s) = -0.22 to -0.54), and with increased expression of NT5C2 and USMG5
(r(s) = 0.25 to 0.58). Taking other possibly influential variables into account
in multivariable linear models did only to a minor extent alter the strength of
the associations. In conclusion, the AS3MT haplotype status strongly predicted
DNA methylation and gene expression of AS3MT as well as several genes in 10q24.
This raises the possibility that several genes in this region are important for
arsenic metabolism.

Hypertension and arterial stiffness are associated with an increasing risk of
diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to identify genetic
variants affecting hypertension and arterial stiffness in diabetic subjects and
to compare genetic associations with hypertension between prediabetic and
diabetic subjects. A total of 1,069 participants (326 prediabetic and 743
diabetic subjects) were assessed to determine the genetic variants affecting
hypertension by analyzing 52 SNPs previously reported to be associated with
hypertension. Moreover, the SNPs were tested for association with hemodynamic
parameters related to hypertension. Out of the 52 SNPs analyzed, four SNPs
including rs5326 (DRD1), rs1004467 (CYP17A1), rs2960306 (GRK4), and rs11191548
(near NT5C2) in diabetic subjects and rs1530440 (C10orf107) in prediabetic
subjects showed a modest association with hypertension (P = 0.0265, 0.0020,
0.0066, 0.0078, and 0.0015, resp; all were insignificant after Bonferroni
correction). Of these SNPs, rs1004467 in CYP17A1 was significantly associated
with augmentation index in diabetic subjects who were not taking antihypertensive
medication (P = 0.0001; corrected P = 0.006) but not in diabetic subjects
receiving antihypertensive medication. This finding suggests that certain genetic
variations found in diabetic subjects may confer arterial stiffness and the
development of hypertension and also be affected by antihypertensive medication.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of gemcitabine pathway
SNPs with detailed pharmacokinetic measures obtained from solid tumor patients
receiving gemcitabine-based therapy.
MATERIALS & METHODS: SNPs within nine gemcitabine pathway genes, namely CDA,
CMPK, DCK, DCTD, NT5C2, NT5C3, SLC28A1, SLC28A3 and SLC29A1 were analyzed for
association with gemcitabine pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: Significant association of gemcitabine clearance with SNPs in NT5C2 was 
identified. Clearance of 2´,2´-difluorodeoxyuridine, a gemcitabine metabolite was
significantly predicted by CDA, SLC29A1 and NT5C2 SNPs. This study reports an
association of formation clearance of 2´,2´-difluoro-2´-deoxycytidine
triphosphate, an active form of gemcitabine with SNPs within uptake transporters 
SLC28A1, SLC28A3 and SLC29A1.
CONCLUSION: Genetic variation in gemcitabine pathway genes is associated with its
pharmacokinetics and hence could influence gemcitabine response. Our study
identified pharmacogenetic markers that could be further tested in larger patient
cohorts and could open up opportunities to individualize therapy in solid tumor
patients.

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) regulates the intracellular nucleotide pools
within the cell by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside
5'-monophosphates. Beside this physiological function, high level of cN-II
expression is correlated with abnormal patient outcome when treated with
cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. To identify its specific role in the resistance
phenomenon observed during cancer therapy, we screened a particular class of
chemical compounds, namely ribonucleoside phosphonates to predict them as
potential cN-II inhibitors. These compounds incorporate a chemically and
enzymatically stable phosphorus-carbon linkage instead of a regular phosphoester 
bond. Amongst them, six compounds were predicted as better ligands than the
natural substrate of cN-II, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). The study of purine
and pyrimidine containing analogues and the introduction of chemical
modifications within the phosphonate chain has allowed us to define general rules
governing the theoretical affinity of such ligands. The binding strength of these
compounds was scrutinized in silico and explained by an impressive number of van 
der Waals contacts, highlighting the decisive role of three cN-II residues that
are Phe 157, His 209 and Tyr 210. Docking predictions were confirmed by
experimental measurements of the nucleotidase activity in the presence of the
three best available phosphonate analogues. These compounds were shown to induce 
a total inhibition of the cN-II activity at 2 mM. Altogether, this study
emphasizes the importance of the non-hydrolysable phosphonate bond in the design 
of new competitive cN-II inhibitors and the crucial hydrophobic stacking promoted
by three protein residues.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gemcitabine is widely used to treat non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacogenomic effects
of the entire gemcitabine metabolic pathway, we genotyped single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 17 pathway genes using DNA samples from patients 
with NSCLC treated with gemcitabine to determine the effect of genetic variants
within gemcitabine pathway genes on overall survival (OS) of patients with NSCLC 
after treatment of gemcitabine.
METHODS: Eight of the 17 pathway genes were resequenced with DNA samples from
Coriell lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) using Sanger sequencing for all exons,
exon-intron junctions, and 5'-, 3'-UTRs. A total of 107 tagging SNPs were
selected on the basis of the resequencing data for the eight genes and on HapMap 
data for the remaining nine genes, followed by successful genotyping of 394 NSCLC
patient DNA samples. Association of SNPs/haplotypes with OS was performed using
the Cox regression model, followed by functional studies performed with LCLs and 
NSCLC cell lines.
RESULTS: Five SNPs in four genes (CDA, NT5C2, RRM1, and SLC29A1) showed
associations with OS of those patients with NSCLC, as well as nine haplotypes in 
four genes (RRM1, RRM2, SLC28A3, and SLC29A1) with a P value of less than 0.05.
Genotype imputation using the LCLs was performed for a region of 200 kb
surrounding those SNPs, followed by association studies with gemcitabine
cytotoxicity. Functional studies demonstrated that downregulation of SLC29A1,
NT5C2, and RRM1 in NSCLC cell lines altered cell susceptibility to gemcitabine.
CONCLUSION: These studies help in identifying biomarkers to predict gemcitabine
response in NSCLC, a step toward the individualized chemotherapy of lung cancer.

IMP preferring cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) is a widespread enzyme whose 
amino acid sequence is highly conserved among vertebrates. Fluctuations of its
activity have been reported in some pathological conditions and its mRNA levels
have been proposed as a prognostic factor for poor outcome in patients with adult
acute myeloid leukemia. As a member of the oxypurine cycle, cN-II is involved in 
the regulation of intracellular concentration of 5'-inosine monophosphate (IMP), 
5'-guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and also 5-phosphoribose 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP)
and is therefore involved in the regulation of purine and pyrimidine de novo and 
salvage synthesis. In addition, several studies demonstrated the involvement of
cN-II in pro-drug metabolism. Notwithstanding some publications indicating that
cN-II is essential for the survival of several cell types, its role in cell
metabolism remains uncertain. To address this issue, we built two eucaryotic
cellular models characterized by different cN-II expression levels: a
constitutive cN-II knockdown in the astrocytoma cell line (ADF) by short hairpin 
RNA (shRNA) strategy and a cN-II expression in the diploid strain RS112 of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Preliminary results suggest that cN-II is essential for
cell viability, probably because it is directly involved in the regulation of
nucleotide pools. These two experimental approaches could be very useful for the 
design of a personalized chemotherapy.

Visceral fat accumulation has an important role in increasing the morbidity and
mortality rates, by increasing the risk of developing several metabolic
disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension. New genetic
loci that are associated with increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures
have been identified by genome-wide association studies in Caucasian populations.
This study investigates whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
confer susceptibility to high blood pressure are also associated with visceral
fat obesity. We genotyped 1279 Japanese subjects (556 men and 723 women) who
underwent computed tomography for measuring the visceral fat area (VFA) and
subcutaneous fat area (SFA) at the following SNPs: FGF5 rs16998073, CACNB2
rs11014166, C10orf107 rs1530440, CYP17A1 rs1004467, NT5C2 rs11191548, PLEKHA7
rs381815, ATP2B1 rs2681472 and rs2681492, ARID3B rs6495112, CSK rs1378942, PLCD3 
rs12946454, and ZNF652 rs16948048. In an additive model, risk alleles of the
CYP17A1 rs1004467 and NT5C2 rs11191548 were found to be significantly associated 
with reduced SFA (P=0.00011 and 0.0016, respectively). When the analysis was
performed separately in men and women, significant associations of rs1004467
(additive model) and rs11191548 (recessive model) with reduced VFA (P=0.0018 and 
0.0022, respectively) and SFA (P=0.00039 and 0.00059, respectively) were observed
in women, but not in men. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in the CYP17A1
and NT5C2 genes influence a reduction in both visceral and subcutaneous fat mass 
in Japanese women.

Suppression of 5'-nucleotidase enzymes promotes AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) phosphorylation and metabolism in human and mouse skeletal muscle.

The 5'-nucleotidase (NT5) family of enzyme dephosphorylates non-cyclic nucleoside
monophosphates to produce nucleosides and inorganic phosphates. We hypothesized
that gene silencing of NT5 enzymes to increase the intracellular availability of 
AMP would increase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and metabolism.
We determined the role of cytosolic NT5 in metabolic responses linked to the
development of insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Using siRNA to 
silence NT5C2 expression in cultured human myotubes, we observed a 2-fold
increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, a 2.4-fold increase in AMPK phosphorylation
(Thr(172)), and a 2.8-fold increase in acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation
(Ser(79)) (p < 0.05). siRNA silencing of NT5C2 expression increased palmitate
oxidation by 2-fold in the absence and by 8-fold in the presence of
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside. This was paralleled by an
increase in glucose transport and a decrease in glucose oxidation, incorporation 
into glycogen, and lactate release from NT5C2-depleted myotubes. Gene silencing
of NT5C1A by shRNA injection and electroporation in mouse tibialis anterior
muscle reduced protein content (60%; p < 0.05) and increased phosphorylation of
AMPK (60%; p < 0.05) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (50%; p < 0.05) and glucose
uptake (20%; p < 0.05). Endogenous expression of NT5C enzymes inhibited basal
lipid oxidation and glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Reduction of
5'-nucleotidase expression or activity may promote metabolic flexibility in type 
2 diabetes.

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (NT5C2) is involved in the development of
1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) resistance and has been associated with
clinical outcome in patients receiving ara-C-based chemotherapy. NT5C2
inactivates ara-C by dephosphorylating ara-C monophosphate to ara-C. In this
study, we sequenced NT5C2 in genomic DNA samples from International HapMap
project panels with European [Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEU); n =
90] or African [Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); n = 90] ancestry. We
identified 41 genetic variants [one insertion-deletion and 40 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs)], including three nonsynonymous SNPs (Y3A, K47R, and Q136R).
Twenty-five SNPs were novel and 16 overlapped with the HapMap data. Subjects with
African ancestry had NT5C2 mRNA expression levels that was significantly higher
than those with European ancestry (p = 0.005). Furthermore, there was a
correlation between NT5C2 mRNA expression and ara-C sensitivity in CEU but not in
YRI cell lines. None of the nonsynonymous SNPs demonstrated any effect on NT5C2
activity. The genotypes of several SNPs were significantly associated with NT5C2 
mRNA expression and/or ara-C sensitivity in CEU cell lines, but very few were
significant in YRI cell lines. Of most interest, SNPs (linkage disequilibrium
group CEU.12) in the 5'-untranslated region were associated with NT5C2 expression
and ara-C sensitivity in HapMap cell lines and with NT5C2 mRNA expression and
ara-C sensitivity in diagnostic leukemic blasts from pediatric patients with
acute myeloid leukemia. Functional genomics analysis demonstrated that the
promoter SNP rs11191612 was associated with altered luciferase activation in
reporter assays and altered DNA-protein binding in gel shift assays. These
results suggest that genetic variations in NT5C2 influence its expression and,
potentially, cellular responses to nucleoside analogs.

Structural basis for the allosteric regulation and substrate recognition of human
cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II.

Walldén K(1), Nordlund P.

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of
6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5'-monophosphates and participates in the regulation
of purine nucleotide pools within the cell. It interferes with the
phosphorylation-dependent activation of nucleoside analogues used in the
treatment of cancer and viral diseases. It is allosterically activated by a
number of phosphate-containing cellular metabolites such as ATP, diadenosine
polyphosphates, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which couple its activity with the
metabolic state of the cell. We present seven high-resolution structures of human
cN-II, including a ligand-free form and complexes with various substrates and
effectors. These structures reveal the structural basis for the allosteric
activation of cN-II, uncovering a mechanism where an effector-induced
disorder-to-order transition generates rearrangements within the catalytic site
and the subsequent coordination of the catalytically essential magnesium. Central
to the activation is the large transition of the catalytically essential Asp356. 
This study also provides the structural basis for the substrate specificity of
cN-II, where Arg202, Asp206, and Phe157 seem to be important residues for
purine/pyrimidine selectivity. These structures provide a comprehensive
structural basis for the design of cN-II inhibitors. They also contribute to the 
understanding of how the nucleotide salvage pathway is regulated at a molecular
level.

kinase/cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II expression ratio in primary acute myeloid
leukemia cells.

Cytarabine (ara-C) is the key agent for treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
After being transported into leukemic cells by human equilibrative nucleoside
transporter 1 (hENT1), ara-C is phosphorylated to ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP),
an active metabolite, and then incorporated into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA
synthesis. Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II)
are associated with the production of ara-CTP. Because ara-C's cytotoxicity
depends on ara-CTP production, parameters that are most related to ara-CTP
formation would predict ara-C sensitivity and the clinical outcome of ara-C
therapy. The present study focused on finding any correlation between the
capacity to produce ara-CTP and ara-C-metabolizing factors. In vitro ara-CTP
production, mRNA levels of hENT1, dCK, and cN-II, and ara-C sensitivity were
evaluated in 34 blast samples from 33 leukemic patients including 26 with AML. A 
large degree of heterogeneity was seen in the capacity to produce ara-CTP and in 
mRNA levels of hENT1, dCK, and cN-II. Despite the lack of any association between
each of the transcript levels and ara-CTP production, the ratio of dCK/cN-II
transcript levels correlated significantly with the amount of ara-CTP among AML
samples. The HL-60 cultured leukemia cell line and its three ara-C-resistant
variants (HL-60/R1, HL-60/R2, HL-60/R3), which were 8-, 10-, and 500-fold more
resistant than HL-60, respectively, were evaluated similarly. The dCK/cN-II ratio
was again proportional to ara-CTP production and to ara-C sensitivity. The
dCK/cN-II ratio may thus predict the capacity for ara-CTP production and
ultimately, ara-C sensitivity in AML.

mRNA expression levels of certain genes have shown predictive value for the
outcome of cytarabine-treated AML-patients. We hypothesized that genetic variants
play a role in the regulation of the transcription of these genes. We studied
leukoblasts from 82 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and observed various
extent and frequency of differential allelic expression in the CDA, DCK, NT5C2,
NT5C3, and TP53 genes. Our attempts to identify the causative regulatory single
nucleotide polymorphisms by a bioinformatics approach did not succeed. However,
our results indicate that genetic variations are at least in part responsible for
the differences in overall expression levels of these genes.

IMP preferring cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase (cN-II) is an ubiquitous nucleotide
hydrolysing enzyme. The enzyme is widely distributed and its amino acid sequence 
is highly conserved among vertebrates. Fluctuations of cN-II activity have been
associated with the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. The enzyme appears to
be involved in the regulation of the intracellular availability of the purine
precursor IMP and also of GMP and AMP, but the contribution of this activity and 
of its regulation to cell metabolism and to CNS cell functions remains uncertain.
To address this issue, we used a vector based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy 
to knockdown cN-II activity in human astrocytoma cells. Our results demonstrated 
that 53 h after transduction, cN-II mRNA was reduced to 17.9+/-0.03% of control
cells. 19 h later enzyme activity was decreased from 0.7+/-0.026 mU/mg in control
ADF cells to 0.45+/-0.046 mU/mg, while cell viability (evaluated by the MTT
reduction assay) decreased up to 0.59+/-0.01 (fold vs control) and caspase 3
activity increased from 136+/-5.8 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) in control cells to
639+/-37.5 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) in silenced cells, thus demonstrating that cN-II
is essential for cell survival. The decrease of enzyme activity causes apoptosis 
of the cultured cells without altering intracellular nucleotide and nucleoside
concentration or energy charge. Since cN-II is highly expressed in tumour cells, 
our finding offers a new possible therapeutical approach especially against
primary brain tumours such as glioblastoma, and to ameliorate chemotherapy
against leukemia.

Recent advances in structure and function of cytosolic IMP-GMP specific
5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II).

Cytosolic 5' nucleotidase II (cN-II) catalyses both the hydrolysis of a number of
nucleoside monophosphates (e.g., IMP + H₂O--> inosine + Pi), and the phosphate
transfer from a nucleoside monophosphate donor to the 5' position of a nucleoside
acceptor (e.g., IMP + guanosine --> inosine + GMP). The enzyme protein functions 
through the formation of a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate, followed by the
phosphate transfer either to water (phosphatase activity) or to a nucleoside
(phosphotransferase activity). It has been proposed that cN-II regulates the
intracellular concentration of IMP and GMP and the production of uric acid. The
enzyme might also have a potential therapeutic importance, since it can
phosphorylate some anti-tumoral and antiviral nucleoside analogues that are not
substrates of known kinases. In this review we summarise our recent studies on
the structure, regulation and function of cN-II. Via a site-directed mutagenesis 
approach, we have identified the amino acids involved in the catalytic mechanism 
and proposed a structural model of the active site. A series of in vitro studies 
suggests that cN-II might contribute to the regulation of
5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) level, through the so-called oxypurine
cycle, and in the production of intracellular adenosine, formed by ATP
degradation.

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine
nucleoside 5'-monophosphates and regulates the IMP and GMP pools within the cell.
It possesses phosphotransferase activity and thereby also catalyzes the reverse
reaction. Both reactions are allosterically activated by adenine-based
nucleotides and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. We have solved structures of cytosolic
5'-nucleotidase II as native protein (2.2 Angstrom) and in complex with adenosine
(1.5 Angstrom) and beryllium trifluoride (2.15 Angstrom) The tetrameric enzyme is
structurally similar to enzymes of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily,
including mitochondrial 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase and cytosolic
5'-nucleotidase III but possesses additional regulatory regions that contain two 
allosteric effector sites. At effector site 1 located near a subunit interface we
modeled diadenosine tetraphosphate with one adenosine moiety in each subunit.
This efficiently glues the tetramer subunits together in pairs. The model shows
why diadenosine tetraphosphate but not diadenosine triphosphate activates the
enzyme and supports a role for cN-II during apoptosis when the level of
diadenosine tetraphosphate increases. We have also modeled
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in effector site 1 using one phosphate site from each
subunit. By comparing the structure of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II with that of 
mitochondrial 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase in complex with dGMP, we identified
residues involved in substrate recognition.

The combination of cytarabine (ara-C) with fludarabine is a common approach to
treating resistant acute myeloid leukemia. Success depends on a fludarabine
triphosphate (F-ara-ATP)-mediated increase in the active intracellular metabolite
of ara-C, ara-C 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP). Therapy-resistant leukemia may exhibit
ara-C resistance, the mechanisms of which might induce cross-resistance to
fludarabine with reduced F-ara-ATP formation. The present study evaluated the
effect of combining ara-C and fludarabine on ara-C-resistant leukemic cells in
vitro. Two variant cell lines (R1 and R2) were 8-fold and 10-fold more ara-C
resistant, respectively, than the parental HL-60 cells. Reduced deoxycytidine
kinase activity was demonstrated in R1 and R2 cells, and R2 cells also showed an 
increase in cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II activity. Compared with HL-60 cells, R1 
and R2 cells produced smaller amounts of ara-CTP. Both variants accumulated less 
F-ara-ATP than HL-60 cells and showed cross-resistance to fludarabine nucleoside 
(F-ara-A). R2 cells, however, accumulated much smaller amounts of F-ara-ATP and
were more F-ara-A resistant than R1 cells. In HL-60 and R1 cells, F-ara-A
pretreatment followed by ara-C incubation produced F-ara-ATP concentrations
sufficient for augmenting ara-CTP production, thereby enhancing ara-C
cytotoxicity. No potentiation was observed in R2 cells. Nucleotidase might
preferentially degrade F-ara-A monophosphate over ara-C monophosphate, leading to
reduced F-ara-ATP production and thereby compromising the F-ara-A-mediated
potentiation of ara-C cytotoxicity in R2 cells. Thus, F-ara-A-mediated
enhancement of ara-C cytotoxicity depended on F-ara-ATP accumulation in
ara-C-resistant leukemic cells but ultimately was associated with the mechanism
of ara-C resistance.

Intracellular accumulation of triphosphorylated derivatives is essential for the 
cytotoxic activity of nucleoside analogues. Different mechanisms opposing this
accumulation have been described. We have investigated the dephosphorylation of
monophosphorylated fludarabine (F-ara-AMP) by the purified cytoplasmic
5'-nucleotidase cN-II using HPLC and NMR. These studies clearly showed that cN-II
was able to convert F-ara-AMP into its non phosphorylated form, F-ara-A, with a
Km in the millimolar range and Vmax = 35 nmol/min/mg, with both methods.
Cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase cN-II can degrade this clinically useful cytotoxic
nucleoside analogue and its overexpression is thus likely to be involved in
resistance to this compound.

In many vertebrate tissues, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) either
hydrolyses or phosphorylates a number of purine (monophosphorylated) nucleosides 
through a scheme common to the Haloacid Dehalogenase superfamily members. It
possesses a pivotal role in purine cellular metabolism and it acts on
anti-tumoural and antiviral nucleoside analogues, thus being of potential
therapeutic importance. cN-II is Mg2+-dependent, regulated and stabilised by
several factors such as allosteric effectors ATP and 2,3-DPG, although these are 
not directly involved in the reaction stoichiometry. We review herein the
experimental knowledge currently available about this remarkable enzymatic
activity.

Phosphorylation of ribavirin and viramidine by adenosine kinase and cytosolic
5'-nucleotidase II: Implications for ribavirin metabolism in erythrocytes.

Many nucleoside analog drugs, such as ribavirin and viramidine, are activated or 
metabolized in vivo through 5'-phosphorylation. In this report, we determined the
steady-state kinetic parameters for 5'-monophosphorylation of ribavirin and
viramidine by adenosine kinase. The apparent Km for ribavirin is 540 microM, and 
k(cat) is 1.8 min-1. Its catalytic efficiency of 3.3 x 10(-3) min-1 . microM-1 is
1,200-fold lower than that of adenosine. In contrast to the common belief that
ribavirin is exclusively phosphorylated by adenosine kinase, cytosolic
5'-nucleotidase II was found to catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation in vitro. The 
reaction is optimally stimulated by the physiological concentration of ATP or
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In phosphate-buffered saline plus ATP and
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the apparent Km for ribavirin is 88 microM, and k(cat)
is 4.0 min-1. These findings suggest that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II may be
involved in ribavirin phosphorylation in vivo. Like ribavirin, viramidine was
found to be phosphorylated by either adenosine kinase or cytosolic
5'-nucleotidase II, albeit with a much lower activity. The catalytic efficiency
for viramidine phosphorylation is 10- to 330-fold lower than that of ribavirin,
suggesting that other nucleoside kinase(s) may be involved in viramidine
phosphorylation in vivo. Both ribavirin and viramidine are not phosphorylated by 
deoxycytidine kinase and uridine-cytidine kinase. The coincidence of presence of 
high concentrated 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes suggests that cytosolic
5'-nucleotidase II could play an important role in phosphorylating ribavirin and 
contribute to anabolism of ribavirin triphosphate in erythrocytes. Elucidation of
ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation mechanism should shed light on their in 
vivo metabolism, especially the ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase/phosphotransferase specific for 6-hydroxypurine
monophosphate derivatives (cN-II), belongs to a class of phosphohydrolases that
act through the formation of an enzyme-phosphate intermediate. Sequence alignment
with members of the P-type ATPases/L-2-haloacid dehalogenase superfamily
identified three highly conserved motifs in cN-II and other cytosolic
nucleotidases. Mutagenesis studies at specific amino acids occurring in cN-II
conserved motifs were performed. The modification of the measured kinetic
parameters, caused by conservative and nonconservative substitutions, suggested
that motif I is involved in the formation and stabilization of the covalent
enzyme-phosphate intermediate. Similarly, T249 in motif II as well as K292 in
motif III also contribute to stabilize the phospho-enzyme adduct. Finally, D351
and D356 in motif III coordinate magnesium ion, which is required for catalysis. 
These findings were consistent with data already determined for P-type ATPases,
haloacid dehalogenases and phosphotransferases, thus suggesting that cN-II and
other mammalian 5'-nucleotidases are characterized by a 3D arrangement related to
the 2-haloacid dehalogenase superfold. Structural determinants involved in
differential regulation by nonprotein ligands and redox reagents of the two
naturally occurring cN-II forms generated by proteolysis were ascertained by
combined biochemical and mass spectrometric investigations. These experiments
indicated that the C-terminal region of cN-II contains a cysteine prone to form a
disulfide bond, thereby inactivating the enzyme. Proteolysis events that generate
the observed cN-II forms, eliminating this C-terminal portion, may prevent loss
of enzymic activity and can be regarded as regulatory phenomena.

Substrate and product specificity studies were used to develop inhibitors of the 
cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase I (c-N-I) from myocardium. As measured by Vmax/Km,
c-N-I preferred pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleotides as substrates with thymidine
monophosphate (TMP) being the most efficient. In product inhibition studies,
thymidine inhibited noncompetitively and inorganic phosphate inhibited
competitively, consistent with an ordered release of nucleoside prior to
phosphate. Mirroring nucleotide substrate specificities, pyrimidine nucleosides
were more potent product inhibitors than purine nucleosides. Thus, pyrimidine
nucleotide and nucleoside analogues were developed as inhibitors. Phosphonate
analogues of TMP were synthesized by a novel method. The most potent was the
5'-phosphonate of 3'-deoxythymidine (ddT) (apparent Ki value of 63 nM). In
addition, pyrimidine nucleoside analogues were inhibitors with
5-ethynyl-2',3'-dideoxyuridine being the most potent (apparent Ki value of 3.7
microM). The most potent nucleotide and nucleoside inhibitor were both greater
than 1000-fold more potent inhibiting c-N-I than the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase
II. The nucleoside analogue was also greater than 1000-fold more potent against
c-N-I than the membrane ecto-5'-nucleotidase (e-N). Because the phosphonate
analogues measurably inhibited e-N (apparent Ki values of 6-12 microM), the
selectivity of the phosphonates for c-N-I versus e-N was less (40-200-fold).
Because of the high selectivity for c-N-I versus both of the other
5'-nucleotidases, the nucleoside inhibitors of c-N-I may be useful biochemical
tools in discerning the role that c-N-I plays in generating adenosine within
myocardium.

1. A search for nucleoside phosphotransferase activity in Bacillus cereus led to 
the following results: (i) The phosphotransferase activity was associated with a 
membrane bound 5'-nucleotidase. (ii) The enzyme phosphorylates both purine and
pyrimidine nucleosides as well as 2',3'-dideoxyinosine. (iii) The enzyme was
inhibited by adenylic nucleotide di- and triphosphates, and its nucleotidase
activity was increased in the presence of inosine as phosphate acceptor. 2.
Bacterial and vertebrate 5'-nucleotidases with phosphotransferase activity differ
for several characteristics, such as cellular location, substrate specificity,
magnesium requirement and regulation.
