Interleukin 15 (IL15) is a pleiotropic cytokine that participates in innate and
adaptive immunity along with its receptor α-chain (IL15Rα). In order to
investigate the potential roles of IL15 and IL15Rα in dojo loach (Misgurnus
anguillicaudatus), we firstly cloned the cDNA sequence of Ma-IL15 and Ma-IL15Rα, 
which contain 1096bp and 1236bp and code proteins of 193 amino acids and 210
amino acids, respectively. A short signal peptide and Pfam IL15 domain were found
in Ma-IL15, while a highly conserved sushi domain existed in Ma-IL15Rα. Ontogeny 
analysis indicated that significantly increased expression of Ma-IL15 and Ma-
IL15Rα mRNA were detected in larvae from 1d to 7d post hatching, while relative
high expression levels were detected in both systematic and mucosal
immune-related tissues of adult dojo loach. Then three dojo loach infection
models with F. columnare G4, I. multifiliis and Saprolegnia parasitica were
constructed, which resulted in increased skin goblet cells and serious lesions in
gill. Ma-IL15 and Ma-IL15Rα showed different expression patterns in different
tissues during three infection models. Ma-IL15Rα mRNA was found to be more
significantly elevated than Ma-IL15 after infection with F. columnare G4 in all
examined tissues including kidney, spleen, gill and skin. I. multifiliis
infection induced higher expression of Ma-IL15 in mucosal tissues including skin 
and gill, while it mainly increased Ma-IL15Rα expression in kidney. Moreover, our
study firstly evaluated the influence of fungal infection on IL15 and IL15Rα
expression in teleost, and it is interesting to find that both Ma-IL15 and
Ma-IL15Rα expression showed consistent up-regulation after Saprolegnia parasitica
infection compared to two other infection models. Therefore, our results suggest 
that Ma-IL15 and Ma-IL15Rα possess important defensive roles in systematic and
mucosal tissues of dojo loach during bacterial, fungal and parasitic infection.

The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-15 (IL15) and its receptor α (IL15RA)
participate in the regulation of musculoskeletal function and metabolism.
Deletion of the Il15ra gene in mice increases spontaneous activity, improves
fatigue resistance in the glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and protects
from diet-induced obesity. In humans, IL15RA single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) have been linked to muscle strength, metabolism and performance in elite
endurance athletes. Taken together, these features suggest a possible role for
IL15RA in muscle mitochondrial structure and function. Here, we have investigated
the consequences of loss of IL15RA on skeletal muscle fiber-type properties and
mitochondrial ultrastructure. Immunostaining of the EDL for myosin heavy chain
(MyHC) isoforms revealed no significant changes in fiber type. Electron
microscopy (EM) analysis of the EDL indicated an overall higher mitochondria
content, and increased cristae density in subsarcolemmal and A-band mitochondrial
subpopulations. The higher cristae density in Il15ra -/- mitochondria was
associated with higher OPA1 and cardiolipin levels. Overall, these data extend
our understanding of the role of IL15RA signaling in muscle oxidative metabolism 
and adaptation to exercise.

Malignant cell growth within patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(B-CLL) is largely restricted to lymphoid tissues, particularly lymph nodes. The 
recent in vitro finding that TLR-9 ligand (oligodeoxynucleotide [ODN]) and IL-15 
exhibit strong synergy in promoting B-CLL growth may be particularly relevant to 
growth in these sites. This study shows IL-15-producing cells are prevalent
within B-CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes and, using purified B-CLL cells from blood, 
investigates the mechanism for ODN and IL-15 synergy in driving B-CLL growth. ODN
boosts baseline levels of phospho-RelA(S529) in B-CLL and promotes NF-κB-driven
increases in IL15RA and IL2RB mRNA, followed by elevated IL-15Rα and IL-2/IL-15Rβ
(CD122) protein. IL-15→CD122 signaling during a critical interval, 20 to 36-48 h 
following initial ODN exposure, is required for optimal induction of the cycling 
process. Furthermore, experiments with neutralizing anti-IL-15 and anti-CD122
mAbs indicate that clonal expansion requires continued IL-15/CD122 signaling
during cycling. The latter is consistent with evidence of heightened IL2RB mRNA
in the fraction of recently proliferated B-CLL cells within patient peripheral
blood. Compromised ODN+IL-15 growth with limited cell density is consistent with 
a role for upregulated IL-15Rα in facilitating homotypic trans IL-15 signaling,
although there may be other explanations. Together, the findings show that ODN
and IL-15 elicit temporally distinct signals that function in a coordinated
manner to drive B-CLL clonal expansion.

PURPOSE: Traditional classification of melanoma is widely utilized with little
apparent results making the development of robust classifiers that can guide
therapies an urgency. Successful seminal research on classification has provided 
a wider understanding of cancer from multiple molecular profiles, respectively.
However, it may ignore the complementary nature of the information provided by
different types of data, which motivated us to subtype melanoma by aggregating
multiple genomic platform data.
METHODS: Aggregating three omics data of 328 melanoma samples, melanoma subtyping
was performed by three clustering methods. Differences across subtypes were
extracted by functional enrichment, epigenetically silencing, gene mutations and 
clinical features. Subtypes were further distinguished by putative biomarkers.
RESULTS: Functional enrichment of the subtype-specific differential expression
genes endowed subtypes new designation: immune, melanin and ion, in which the
first subtype was enriched for immune system, the second was characterized by
melanin and pigmentation, and the third was enriched for ion-involved
transmission process. Subtypes also differed in age, Breslow thickness, tumor
site, mutation frequency of BRAF, PTGS2, CDKN2A, CDKN2B and incidence of
epigenetically silencing for IL15RA, EPSTI1, LXN, CDKN1B genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Skin cutaneous melanoma can be robustly divided into three subtypes 
by SNFCC+. Compared with the TCGA classification derived from gene expression,
the subtypes we presented share concordance, but new traits are excavated. Such a
genomic classification offers insights to further personalize therapeutic
decision-making and melanoma management.

Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and 
Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of
research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds
reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the
variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using
Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both
countries, namely Banat's White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and
Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes
(PTX3, IL6, CLEC4E, IL8, IL1RN, IL15RA, TNFSF13, SOCS3, TNF and TLR3) in 150
animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The
PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected
heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed
heterozygosity was obtained for IL15RA g.10343904C>T in Banat's White (0.464),
IL15RA g.10354813C>T in Carpatina (0.577) and SOCS3 g.52626440T>G in Hungarian
Milking (0.588). Pairwise FST values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and
Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship 
among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the
Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%),
whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value 
of MAF was obtained for SOCS3 g.52626440T>G (0.46), IL15RA g.10343904C>T (0.47), 
IL15RA g.10344025C>T (0.45), and IL15RA g.10354813C>T (0.42). The 16 polymorphic 
SNPs identified in a panel of 150 unrelated individuals belonging to three
Romanian and Hungarian indigenous goat breeds could be used in future genomic
based breeding schemes as markers for genetic resistance to mastitis and
gastrointestinal parasitism in goat breeds found in Eastern and Central Europe.

Treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) cells with sublethal doses of genotoxic drugs 
leads to senescence and results in increased NK cell recognition and effector
functions. Herein, we demonstrated that doxorubicin- and melphalan-treated
senescent cells display increased expression of IL15, a cytokine involved in NK
cell activation, proliferation, and maturation. IL15 upregulation was evident at 
the mRNA and protein level, both in MM cell lines and malignant plasma cells from
patients' bone marrow (BM) aspirates. However, IL15 was detectable as a soluble
cytokine only in vivo, thus indicating a functional role of IL15 in the BM tumor 
microenvironment. The increased IL15 was accompanied by enhanced expression of
the IL15/IL15RA complex on the membrane of senescent myeloma cells, allowing the 
functional trans-presentation of this cytokine to neighboring NK cells, which
consequently underwent activation and proliferation. We demonstrated that MM
cell-derived exosomes, the release of which was augmented by melphalan treatment 
in senescent cells, also expressed IL15RA and IL15, and their interaction with NK
cells in the presence of exogenous IL15 resulted in increased proliferation.
Altogether, our data demonstrated that low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs, by
inducing tumor cell senescence and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype,
promoted IL15 trans-presentation to NK cells and, in turn, their activation and
proliferation, thus enhancing NK cell-tumor immune surveillance and providing new
insights for the exploitation of senescence-based cancer therapies. Cancer

Autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic islet β cells results in type 1
diabetes (T1D). Serum islet autoantibodies usually develop in genetically
susceptible individuals in early childhood before T1D onset, with multiple islet 
autoantibodies predicting diabetes development. However, most at-risk children
remain islet-antibody negative, and no test currently identifies those likely to 
seroconvert. We sought a genomic signature predicting seroconversion risk by
integrating longitudinal peripheral blood gene expression profiles collected in
high-risk children included in the BABYDIET and DIPP cohorts, of whom 50
seroconverted. Subjects were followed for 10 years to determine time of
seroconversion. Any cohort effect and the time of seroconversion were corrected
to uncover genes differentially expressed (DE) in seroconverting children. Gene
expression signatures associated with seroconversion were evident during the
first year of life, with 67 DE genes identified in seroconverting children
relative to those remaining antibody negative. These genes contribute to T cell-,
DC-, and B cell-related immune responses. Near-birth expression of ADCY9, PTCH1, 
MEX3B, IL15RA, ZNF714, TENM1, and PLEKHA5, along with HLA risk score predicted
seroconversion (AUC 0.85). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway linked DE genes and
T1D susceptibility genes. Therefore, a gene expression signature in infancy
predicts risk of seroconversion. Ubiquitination may play a mechanistic role in
diabetes progression.

Using a novel and fast genotyping method called Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR
(KASP™), we carried out a pilot study on 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) belonging to 40 genes in French Alpine (n = 24) and Saanen (n = 25) goats 
reared in Romania. Furthermore, the associations of the 13 polymorphic genetic
variants with milk production and composition were investigated. Thirty-five SNPs
did not show polymorphism in the studied populations. Polymorphic SNPs were
detected in the following genes: CAST, CLEC4E, DES, GHRHR, HSP90AA1, IL15RA,
IL1RN, IL8, MITF, PPRC1, SOCS3, TNF and TNFSF13. The studied Alpine population
was in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium at the g.62894878A>G locus (rs671391101)
(P < 0.05). The results showed that four SNPs rs671391101 (GHRHR), rs640582069
(IL1RN) rs635583012 (SOCS3) and rs635969404 (IL15RA) out of the 13 polymorphic
markers were significantly associated with milk production, protein, fat and
lactose content in the Alpine breed. However, no significant effect was recorded 
in the Saanen population regarding milk yield or milk chemical composition. The
current results provide new insights for the development of SNP marker-assisted
selection technology in the goat industry and confirm the potential of using SNPs
for the GHRHR, IL1RN, SOCS3, and IL15RA genes as candidate genes for selection,
highlighting the direct implications of such genes for farm production outputs.
The results from this study are relevant for future goat genomic studies and the 
inclusion of the associated traits into up-to-date selection schemes.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease often requires intestinal resection, which is not
considered curative. Repeat surgical intervention is necessary in more than half 
of patients after their initial operation. Although many genetic loci are
implicated in Crohn's disease, few have been associated with post-resection
recurrence.
STUDY DESIGN: A cohort of patients with Crohn's disease who underwent intestinal 
resection was analyzed to determine genetic and clinical factors associated with 
post-resection recurrence. Genotype was assessed at 8 loci associated with
adaptive immunity (SMAD3, IL10RB, IL15RA, BACH2, IL12B, IL18RAP, IFNGR2, and
JAK2). Univariate and multivariable survival analyses were performed using a
log-rank test and Cox-proportional hazard model, respectively.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one patients with Crohn's disease and 11.2 years 
mean postoperative follow-up were included. Forty-six percent experienced a
surgical recurrence. Factors associated with increased incidence of recurrence
included male sex (p = 0.05) and shortened time to first intestinal operation
(5.0 vs 7.3 years; p = 0.03); inflammatory disease behavior was associated with a
lower chance of repeat operation (p < 0.01). Of the loci assessed on
multivariable analysis, homozygosity for a risk allele at BACH2 (rs1847472) was
significantly associated with disease recurrence (hazard ratio 1.54; 95% CI 1.00 
to 2.36; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We identify BACH2 as a susceptibility locus for postoperative
recurrence of Crohn's disease in our cohort. BACH2 is critical in the
differentiation and function of T cells, as a regulator of B-cell activity, and
is associated with several dysregulated immunologic phenomena. Its identification
as a risk locus in postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence suggests a potential 
role for regulatory T cells, effector T cells, humoral immunity, and immunologic 
memory in the development of this disease process.

A subset of hematologic cancer patients is refractory to treatment or suffers
relapse, due in part to minimal residual disease, whereby some cancer cells
survive treatment. Cell-adhesion-mediated drug resistance is an important
mechanism, whereby cancer cells receive survival signals via interaction with
e.g. stromal cells. No genome-wide studies of in vitro systems have yet been
performed to compare gene expression in different cell subsets within a
co-culture and cells grown separately. Using RNA sequencing and species-specific 
read mapping, we compared transcript levels in human Jeko-1 mantle cell lymphoma 
cells stably adhered to mouse MS-5 stromal cells or in suspension within a
co-culture or cultured separately as well as in stromal cells in co-culture or in
separate culture. From 1050 differentially expressed transcripts in adherent
mantle cell lymphoma cells, we identified 24 functional categories that together 
represent four main functional themes, anti-apoptosis, B-cell signaling, cell
adhesion/migration and early mitosis. A comparison with previous mantle cell
lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia studies, of gene expression differences
between lymph node and blood, identified 116 genes that are differentially
expressed in all three studies. From these genes, we suggest a core set of genes 
(CCL3, CCL4, DUSP4, ETV5, ICAM1, IL15RA, IL21R, IL4I1, MFSD2A, NFKB1, NFKBIE,
SEMA7A, TMEM2) characteristic of cells undergoing cell-adhesion-mediated
microenvironment signaling in mantle cell lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 
The model system developed and characterized here together with the core gene set
will be useful for future studies of pathways that mediate increased cancer cell 
survival and drug resistance mechanisms.

Background: Topiramate (TPM) is suggested to be a promising medication for
treatment of methamphetamine (METH) dependence, but the molecular basis remains
to be elucidated.
Methods: Among 140 METH-dependent participants randomly assigned to receive
either TPM (N = 69) or placebo (N = 71) in a previously conducted randomized
controlled trial, 50 TPM- and 49 placebo-treated participants had a total 212 RNA
samples available at baseline, week 8, and week 12 time points. Following our
primary analysis of gene expression data, we reanalyzed the microarray expression
data based on a latent class analysis of binary secondary outcomes during weeks
1-12 that provided a classification of 21 responders and 31 non-responders with
consistent responses at both time points.
Results: Based on secondary outcomes, 1,381, 576, 905, and 711 differentially
expressed genes at nominal P values < 0.05 were identified in responders versus
non-responders for week 8 TPM, week 8 placebo, week 12 TPM, and week 12 placebo
groups, respectively. Among 1,381 genes identified in week 8 TPM responders, 359 
genes were identified in both week 8 and week 12 TPM groups, of which 300 genes
were exclusively detected in TPM responders. Of them, 32 genes had nominal P
values < 5 × 10-3 at either week 8 or week 12 and false discovery rates < 0.15 at
both time points with consistent directions of gene expression changes, which
include GABARAPL1, GPR155, and IL15RA in GABA receptor signaling that represent
direct targets for TPM. Analyses of these 300 genes revealed 7 enriched pathways 
belonging to neuronal function/synaptic plasticity, signal transduction,
inflammation/immune function, and oxidative stress response categories. No
pathways were enriched for 72 genes exclusively detected in both week 8 and week 
12 placebo groups.
Conclusion: This secondary analysis study of gene expression data from a TPM
clinical trial not only yielded consistent results with those of primary analysis
but also identified additional new genes and pathways on TPM response to METH
addiction.

Microglia are glial-immune cells that are essential for the function and survival
of the central nervous system. Microglia not only protect neural tissues from
immunological insults, but also play a critical role in neural development and
repair. However, little is known about the biology of microglia in the cochlea,
the auditory portion of the inner ear. In this study, we detected TMEM119+,
CD11b+, CD45+ and Iba1+ populations of cells in the rat cochlea, particularly in 
Rosenthal's canal, inner sulcus and stria vascularis. Next, we isolated and
enriched the population of CD11b+ cells from the cochlea and immortalized these
cells with the 12S E1A gene of adenovirus in a replication-incompetent retroviral
vector to derive a novel microglial cell line, designated Mocha (microglia of the
cochlea). The resulting Mocha cells express a number of markers consistent with
microglia and respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation by upregulation of 
genes (Cox2, ICAM-1, Il6r, Ccl2, Il13Ra and Il15Ra) as well as releasing
cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-12, IL-13 and RANTES). As evidence of microglial
function, Mocha cells phagocytose fluorescent beads at 37°C, but not at 4°C. The 
expression pattern of microglial markers in Mocha cells suggests that
immortalization leads to a more primitive phenotype, a common phenomenon in
immortalized cell lines. In summary, Mocha cells display key characteristics of
microglia and are now available as a useful model system for the study of
cochlear microglial behavior, both in vitro and in vivo.

Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune condition triggered by dietary gluten in
genetically predisposed individuals and the treatment is a strict gluten-free
diet. The major predisposing genes are HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1, but these are not
sufficient for disease development. One of the candidate genes worth studying is 
interleukin (IL)-15 gene, together with its specific receptor, IL-15Rα, as they
participate in promoting lymphocyte signaling and survival, and the establishment
of appropriate conditions for villous atrophy, then acting as key players in the 
immunopathogenesis of CD. Here we analyze IL-15 and IL-15Rα genes in samples from
the Spanish Consortium for Genetics of Celiac Disease (CEGEC) collection,
identifying two regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that might be
associated with celiac disease: rs4956400 (p-value 0.0112, OR 1.21, 95% CI
1.04-1.40) and rs11100722 (p-value 0.0087, OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.45), both
located upstream the IL15 gene. When the expression of both genes was assessed,
these two SNPs were found to be correlated with IL-15 higher protein expression. 
Besides, rs8177655 from IL15RA was also associated to mRNA IL-15 expression in CD
patients. Finally, three SNPs from IL15RA intronic regions, rs2296141, rs3136614 
and rs3181148, and another from its 3'UTR region, rs2229135, could be related to 
the age of diagnosis of celiac disease patients.

Interleukin-15 receptor alpha (IL15RA) is an important component of
interleukin-15 (IL15) pro-inflammatory signaling. In addition, IL15 and IL15RA
are present in the circulation and are detected in a variety of tissues where
they influence physiological functions such as muscle contractility and overall
metabolism. In the skeletal system, IL15RA was previously shown to be important
for osteoclastogenesis. Little is known, however, about its role in osteoblast
function and bone mineralization. In this study, we evaluated bone structural and
mechanical properties of an Il15ra whole-body knockout mouse (Il15ra-/-) and used
in vitro and bioinformatic analyses to understand the role IL15/IL15RA signaling 
on osteoblast function. We show that lack of IL15RA decreased bone mineralization
in vivo and in isolated primary osteogenic cultures, suggesting a cell-autonomous
effect. Il15ra-/- osteogenic cultures also had reduced Rankl/Opg mRNA ratio,
indicating defective osteoblast/osteoclast coupling. We analyzed the
transcriptome of primary pre-osteoblasts from normal and Il15ra-/- mice and
identified 1150 genes that were differentially expressed at a FDR of 5%. Of
these, 844 transcripts were upregulated and 306 were downregulated in Il15ra-/-
cells. The largest functional clusters, highlighted using DAVID analysis, were
related to metabolism, immune response, bone mineralization and morphogenesis.
The transcriptome analysis was validated by qPCR of some of the most significant 
hits. Using bioinformatic approaches, we identified candidate genes, including
Cd200 and Enpp1, that could contribute to the reduced mineralization. Silencing
Il15ra using shRNA in the calvarial osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell line decreased ENPP1
activity. Taken together, these data support that IL15RA plays a cell-autonomous 
role in osteoblast function and bone mineralization.

Homocysteine mediates transcriptional changes of the inflammatory pathway
signature genes in human retinal pigment epithelial cells.

Singh M(1), Tyagi SC(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine,
Louisville, KY 40202, USA.

AIM: To test whether homocysteine (Hcy) can influence the transcriptional
profile, we hypothesized that Hcy can lead to the induction of proinflammatory
molecules in the retinal cells of aging people.
METHODS: An unbiased in vitro inflammatory pathway focused study was designed
employing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line, ARPE-19. Cells were
cultured in the presence or absence of Hcy to capture target genes' expression
profile. Three different concentrations of Hcy were added in the culture medium
of confluent monolayers. cRNAs were made from the isolated total RNAs and the
labeled cRNA probes were hybridized to microarrays specific for human disease
pathway inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and their receptor gene micro-array
panels as per manufacture's recommendations. Two Hcy up-regulated molecules: IL6 
and CEBPB were further validated via Western blot analysis. Hcy's effect on
ARPE-19 cellular morphology and genomic DNA integrity were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Gene microarray analyses of RPE cells in response to Hcy treatment
revealed alterations in the expressions of several inflammatory gene transcripts 
such as CCL5, CEBPB, IL13RA2, IL15RA, IL6, IL8 and CXCL3 that were up-regulated. 
The transcripts for C3, CCL2, IL11RA and IL18 genes exhibited down-regulation.
The IL6 and CEBPB expressions were subsequently validated at the protein levels. 
Treatment of the retinal cells with increasing Hcy concentration influenced their
density in culture however their morphology and DNA integrity remained
unaffected.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Hcy can potentially mediate the
expression of chemokines, cytokines and interleukins receptors in the retinal
cells without having any debilitating effects on their morphology and the genomic
DNA integrity.

In the present study, the pathogenesis of lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) and
the immune gene expression patterns associated with this viral infection were
determined in the flatfish Senegalese sole. The results indicate that LCDV
spreads rapidly from the peritoneal cavity through the bloodstream to reach
target organs such as kidney, gut, liver, and skin/fin. The viral load was
highest in kidney and reduced progressively thorough the experiment in spite of
the viral major capsid protein gene was transcribed. The LCDV injection activated
a similar set of differentially expressed transcripts in kidney and intestine
although with some differences in the intensity and time-course response. This
set included antiviral-related transcripts (including the mx and
interferon-related factors irf1, irf2, irf3, irf7, irf8, irf9, irf10), cytokines 
(il1b, il6, il8, il12 and tnfa) and their receptors (il1r, il8r, il10r, il15ra,
il17r), chemokines (CXC-type, CC-type and IL-8), prostaglandins (cox-2), g-type
lysozymes, hepcidin, complement fractions (c2, c4-1 and c4-2) and the antigen
differentiation factors cd4, cd8a, and cd8b. The expression profile observed
indicated that the host triggered a systemic defensive response including
inflammation able to cope with the viral challenge.

The genetic background of an individual plays an important role in the
progression of HIV infection to AIDS. Identifying previously unknown or
uncharacterized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associate with
disease progression may reveal important therapeutic targets and provide a
greater understanding of disease pathogenesis. In the present study, we employed 
ultra-high multiplex PCR on an Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing platform to
sequence 23 innate immune genes from 94 individuals with HIV/AIDS. This data was 
used to identify potential associations of SNPs with clinical parameters and
disease progression. SNPs that associated with an increased viral load were
identified in the genes for the interleukin 15 receptor (IL15RA), toll-like
receptor 7 (TLR7), tripartite motif-containing protein 5 (TRIM5), and two
killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3). Additionally,
SNPs that associated with progression from HIV infection to AIDS were identified 
in two 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase genes (OAS2 and OAS3). In contrast, other 
SNPs identified in OAS2 and OAS3 genes, as well as in the TRIM5 and KIR2DS4
genes, were associated with a slower progression of disease. Taken together, our 
data demonstrates the utility of ultra-high multiplex PCR in identifying
polymorphisms of potential clinical significance and further,identifies SNPs that
may play a role in HIV pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Ebola virus is the causative agent of a severe syndrome in humans
with a fatality rate that can approach 90 %. During infection, the host immune
response is thought to become dysregulated, but the mechanisms through which this
happens are not entirely understood. In this study, we analyze RNA sequencing
data to determine the host response to Ebola virus infection in circulating
immune cells.
RESULTS: Approximately half of the 100 genes with the strongest early increases
in expression were interferon-stimulated genes, such as ISG15, OAS1, IFIT2,
HERC5, MX1 and DHX58. Other highly upregulated genes included cytokines CXCL11,
CCL7, IL2RA, IL2R1, IL15RA, and CSF2RB, which have not been previously reported
to change during Ebola virus infection. Comparing this response in two different 
models of exposure (intramuscular and aerosol) revealed a similar signature of
infection. The strong innate response in the aerosol model was seen not only in
circulating cells, but also in primary and secondary target tissues. Conversely, 
the innate immune response of vaccinated macaques was almost non-existent. This
suggests that the innate response is a major aspect of the cellular response to
Ebola virus infection in multiple tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Ebola virus causes a severe infection in humans that is associated
with high mortality. The host immune response to virus infection is thought to be
an important aspect leading to severe pathology, but the components of this
overactive response are not well characterized. Here, we analyzed how circulating
immune cells respond to the virus and found that there is a strong innate
response dependent on active virus replication. This finding is in stark contrast
to in vitro evidence showing a suppression of innate immune signaling, and it
suggests that the strong innate response we observe in infected animals may be an
important contributor to pathogenesis.

One of the major disappointments in autoimmunity has been the relative lack of
informative data when genomewide associations (GWAS) have been applied to
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Indeed, there is increasing
evidence that SLE is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes.
5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine
suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in embryonic development,
cell differentiation and cancer. DNA methylation dynamics have already been
implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, while little is known about
hydroxymethylation in this process. Here, we show an increased 5-hmC level in
genomic DNA in CD4(+) T cells of patients with SLE compared with healthy
controls, accompanied by the up-regulated expression of the Ten-eleven
translocation TET2 and TET3, which can enzymatically convert 5-methylcytosine
(5-mC) to 5-hmC. Moreover, we present the differential patterns of DNA
hydroxymethylation in genome-wide promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared
with healthy controls. We identified 2748 genes with increased 5-hmC levels in
promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells, which were enriched in critical pathways,
including neurotrophin signaling, WNT signaling, MAPK signaling, calcium
signaling and the mTOR signaling pathway. Through a combined analysis of
differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE
CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions
and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls,
including selected immune-related genes, i.e. SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA, which were
also confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CTCF, as a
transcription factor, can mediate DNA hydroxymethylation and contribute to
overexpression of SOCS1 in CD4(+) T cells through binding to the promoter region 
of SOCS1. Taken together, our study reveals a critical differential 5-hmC in the 
genome-wide promoter regions of SLE CD4(+) T cells and provides a novel mechanism
that suggests that DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation 
of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE.

We conducted a genome-wide scan for visceral leishmaniasis in mixed-breed dogs
from a highly endemic area in Brazil using 149,648 single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) markers genotyped in 20 cases and 28 controls. Using a mixed model
approach, we found two candidate loci on canine autosomes 1 and 2. The positional
association on chromosome 2 mapped to a predicted DNAse sensitive site in CD14+
monocytes that serve as a cis-regulatory element for the expression of
interleukin alpha receptors 2 (IL2RA) and 15 (IL15RA). Both interleukins were
previously found to lead to protective T helper 1 cell (Th1) response against
Leishmania spp. in humans and mice. The associated marker on chromosome 1 was
located between two predicted transcription factor binding sites regulating the
expression of the transducin-like enhancer of split 1 gene (TLE1), an important
player in Notch signaling. This pathway is critical for macrophage activity and
CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1 and T helper 2. Together, these findings
suggest that the human and mouse model for protective response against Leishmania
spp., which involves Th1 and macrophage modulation by interleukins 2, 15, gamma
interferon and Notch signaling, may also hold for the canine model.

OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL) -2 receptor subunit α regulates lymphocyte
activation, which plays an important role in atherosclerosis. Associations
between soluble IL-2Rα (sIL-2Rα) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have not been
widely studied and little is known about the genetic determinants of sIL-2Rα
levels.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We measured baseline levels of sIL-2Rα in 4408 European
American (EA) and 766 African American (AA) adults from the Cardiovascular Health
Study (CHS) and examined associations with baseline CVD risk factors, subclinical
CVD, and incident CVD events. We also performed a genome-wide association study
for sIL-2Rα in CHS (2964 EAs and 683 AAs) and further combined CHS EA results
with those from two other EA cohorts in a meta-analysis (n=4464 EAs). In age,
sex- and race- adjusted models, sIL-2Rα was positively associated with current
smoking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, insulin, waist circumference,
C-reactive protein, IL-6, fibrinogen, internal carotid wall thickness, all-cause 
mortality, CVD mortality, and incident CVD, stroke, and heart failure. When
adjusted for baseline CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD, associations with
all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and heart failure remained significant in
both EAs and AAs. In the EA genome-wide association study analysis, we observed
52 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the chromosome 10p15-14 region, which
contains IL2RA, IL15RA, and RMB17, that reached genome-wide significance
(P<5×10(-8)). The most significant single-nucleotide polymorphism was rs7911500
(P=1.31×10(-75)). The EA meta-analysis results were highly consistent with
CHS-only results. No single-nucleotide polymorphisms reached statistical
significance in the AAs.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for sIL-2Rα in atherosclerosis and
provide evidence for multiple-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms at
chromosome 10p15-14.

BACKGROUND: Previous infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and a history of
infectious mononucleosis (IM) have been previously associated with an increased
risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). Whether there are common genetic factors that
may partially explain these associations has not been thoroughly explored.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether select polymorphisms in genes associated with
IM susceptibility are related to MS risk-a self-reported history of IM or
antibody titer against Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (anti-EBNA1).
METHODS: A case-control study including 1213 MS cases and 454 controls enrolled
in the Accelerated Cure Project for MS (ACP) Repository. Select polymorphisms in 
HLA-A, SH2D1A and IL15RA and anti-EBNA1 Ab titers were measured using stored
blood samples provided by participants. Generalized linear models were used to
assess the associations between select polymorphisms and odds of MS, odds of IM
or anti-EBNA1 Ab titers.
RESULTS: No significant associations were observed between the selected
polymorphisms and odds of MS, odds of IM or anti-EBNA1 Ab titer.
CONCLUSION: It is unlikely that any of the studied polymorphisms contribute to
the explaining the association between anti-EBNA1 Ab titer or history of IM and
MS.

Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a putative myokine hypothesized to induce an oxidative 
skeletal muscle phenotype. The specific IL-15 receptor alpha subunit (IL-15Rα)
has also been implicated in specifying this contractile phenotype. The purposes
of this study were to determine the muscle-specific effects of IL-15Rα functional
deficiency on skeletal muscle isometric contractile properties, fatigue
characteristics, spontaneous cage activity, and circulating IL-15 levels in male 
and female mice. Muscle creatine kinase (MCK)-driven IL-15Rα knockout mice
(mIl15ra(fl/fl)/Cre(+)) were generated using the Cre-loxP system. We tested the
hypothesis that IL-15Rα functional deficiency in skeletal muscle would increase
resistance to contraction-induced fatigue, cage activity, and circulating IL-15
levels. There was a significant effect of genotype on the fatigue curves obtained
in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles from female mIl15ra(fl/fl)/Cre(+)
mice, such that force output was greater during the repeated contraction protocol
compared with mIl15ra(fl/fl)/Cre(-) control mice. Muscles from female
mIl15ra(fl/fl)/Cre(+) mice also had a twofold greater amount of the mitochondrial
genome-specific COXII gene compared with muscles from mIl15ra(fl/fl)/Cre(-)
control mice, indicating a greater mitochondrial density in these skeletal
muscles. There was a significant effect of genotype on the twitch:tetanus ratio
in EDL and soleus muscles from mIl15ra(fl/fl)/Cre(+) mice, such that the ratio
was lower in these muscles compared with mIl15ra(fl/fl)/Cre(-) control mice,
indicating a pro-oxidative shift in muscle phenotype. However, spontaneous cage
activity was not different and IL-15 protein levels were lower in male and female
mIl15ra(fl/fl)/Cre(+) mice compared with control. Collectively, these data
support a direct effect of muscle IL-15Rα deficiency in altering contractile
properties and fatigue characteristics in skeletal muscles.

The interleukin-15 (IL-15) system is important for regulating both innate and
adaptive immune responses, however, its role in autoimmune disease remained
unclear. Here we found that Il15(-/-) and Il15ra(-/-) mice spontaneously
developed late-onset autoimmune phenotypes. CD4(+) T cells of the knockout mice
showed elevated autoreactivity as demonstrated by the induction of lymphocyte
infiltration in the lacrimal and salivary glands when transferred into nude mice.
The antigen-presenting cells in the thymic medullary regions expressed IL-15 and 
IL-15Rα, whose deficiency resulted in insufficient negative selection and
elevated number of natural IL-17A-producing CD4(+) thymocytes. These findings
reveal previously unknown functions of the IL-15 system in thymocyte development,
and thus a new layer of regulation in T cell-mediated autoimmunity.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported the association between single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) of IL15 receptor alpha (IL15RA) gene with susceptibility to
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL). However,
the results were still in controversy. Therefore, the purpose of the present
study was to investigate the association between SNPs of IL15RA gene with
susceptibility to OPLL in a Chinese Han population.
METHODS: A total of 235 OPLL patients and 250 age-matched healthy controls were
recruited. All the subjects were genotyped using the PCR (polymerase chain
reaction)-based invader assay. A case-control study was performed to define the
contribution of rs2228059 and rs2296139 to predisposition of OPLL. We also
performed subgroup analysis according to the different gender.
RESULTS: A significant association of rs2228059 with OPLL was observed in the
Chinese Han population (p <0.001, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.26-2.11). The subgroup
analysis showed that there was a significant association between the allele
frequency of rs2228059 and the susceptibility of OPLL in males (p = 0.002, OR =
1.72, 95% CI = 1.23-2.42). However, there was no significant association between 
SNP of rs2296139 and susceptibility to OPLL.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that the SNP of rs2228059 in IL15RA
gene is associated with susceptibility to OPLL in a Chinese Han population,
especially in males.

To understand the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92
cells suggested from our previous study of in vivo anti-allergy and anti-virus
effects, host immune responses in macrophage-like THP-1 cells after 4 h (the
early phase) and 24 h (the late phase) of cocultivation with L-92 cells were
investigated by transcriptome analysis. In the early phase of L-92 treatment,
various transcription regulator genes, such as, NFkB1, NFkB2, JUN, HIVEP2 and
RELB, and genes encoding chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL4, CXCL11, CCL3 and
TNF, were upregulated. Two transmembrane receptor genes, TLR7 and ICAM1, were
also upregulated in the early phase of treatment. In contrast, many transmembrane
receptor genes, such as IL7R, CD80, CRLF2, CD86, CD5, HLA-DQA1, IL2RA, IL15RA and
CSF2RA, and some cytokine genes, including IL6, IL23A and CCL22, were
significantly upregulated in the late phase after L-92 exposure. Some genes
encoding cytokines, such as IL1A, IL1B and IL8, and the enzyme IDO1 were
upregulated at both the early and the late phases of treatment. These results
suggest that probiotic L-92 might promote Th1 and regulatory T-cell responses by 
activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, followed by the NOD-like receptor
signaling pathway in THP-1 cells.

Despite its aggressive nature, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) often
exhibits leucocyte infiltrations that correlate with favorable prognosis. In this
study, we offer an explanation for this apparent conundrum by defining TNBC cell 
subsets that overexpress the IL15 immune receptor IL15RA. This receptor usually
forms a heterotrimer with the IL2 receptors IL2RB and IL2RG, which regulates the 
proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. However,
unlike IL15RA, the IL2RB and IL2RG receptors are not upregulated in basal-like
TNBC breast cancer cells that express IL15RA. Mechanistic investigations
indicated that IL15RA signaling activated JAK1, STAT1, STAT2, AKT, PRAS40, and
ERK1/2 in the absence of IL2RB and IL2RG, whereas neither STAT5 nor JAK2 were
activated. RNAi-mediated attenuation of IL15RA established its role in cell
growth, apoptosis, and migration, whereas expression of the IL15 cytokine in
IL15RA-expressing cells stimulated an autocrine signaling cascade that promoted
cell proliferation and migration and blocked apoptosis. Notably, coexpression of 
IL15RA and IL15 was also sufficient to activate peripheral blood mononuclear
cells upon coculture in a paracrine signaling manner. Overall, our findings offer
a mechanistic explanation for the paradoxical association of some high-grade
breast tumors with better survival outcomes, due to engagement of the immune
stroma.

Gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA) is one of the common malignant tumors in the
world and has a high incidence in China. Both environmental risk factors and
genetic factors might play an essential role in the GCA carcinogenesis. We
performed a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate the genetic effects of 
interleukin 15 (IL15) and IL15 receptor alpha (IL15RA) functional single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the pathogenesis of GCA. A total of 243 GCA
cases and 476 controls were enrolled in this study. The genotypes were determined
using a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscan(TM) Kit. When the IL15RA rs2228059 AA
homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the CC genotype was
correlated with a significantly decreased risk for GCA (CC vs. AA: adjusted OR = 
0.61, 95 % CI = 0.37-0.98, p = 0.042). Our results revealed that functional
variant IL15RA rs2228059 A > C might attenuate individual's risk of GCA. However,
there was no significant association between the other five IL15 SNPs and GCA
susceptibility. This present study demonstrated that IL15RA rs2228059 A > C
polymorphism might modify GCA susceptibility. The results were based on a limited
sample size; future larger studies with more rigorous designs are warranted to
validate our findings.

Disparities in breast cancer biology are evident between American women of
African ancestry (AA) and European ancestry (EA) and may be due, in part, to
differences in immune function. To assess the potential role of constitutional
host immunity on breast carcinogenesis, we tested associations between breast
cancer risk and 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 cytokine-related 
genes of the adaptive immune system using 650 EA (n = 335 cases) and 864 AA (n = 
458 cases) women from the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS). With additional 
participant accrual to the WCHS, promising SNPs from the initial analysis were
evaluated in a larger sample size (1,307 EAs and 1,365 AAs). Multivariate
logistic regression found SNPs in genes important for T helper type 1 (Th1)
immunity (IFNGR2 rs1059293, IL15RA rs2296135, LTA rs1041981), Th2 immunity (IL4R 
rs1801275), and T regulatory cell-mediated immunosuppression (TGFB1 rs1800469)
associated with breast cancer risk, mainly among AAs. The combined effect of
these five SNPs was highly significant among AAs (P-trend = 0.0005). When
stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status, LTA rs1041981 was associated with
ER-positive breast cancers among EAs and marginally among AAs. Only among AA
women, IL15 rs10833 and IL15RA rs2296135 were associated with ER-positive tumors,
and IL12RB1 rs375947, IL15 rs10833 and TGFB1 rs1800469 were associated with
ER-negative tumors. Our study systematically identified genetic variants in the
adaptive immune response pathway associated with breast cancer risk, which
appears to differ by ancestry groups, menopausal status and ER status.

IL-15 is an essential survival factor for CD8αα(+) intestinal intraepithelial
lymphocytes (iIELs) in vitro and in vivo. However, the IL-15-induced survival
signals in primary CD8αα(+) iIELs remains elusive. Although Bcl-2 level in
CD8αα(+) iIELs positively correlates with IL-15Rα expression in the intestinal
epithelial cells, overexpression of Bcl-2 only moderately restores CD8αα(+) γδ
iIELs in Il15(-/-) mice. Here, we found that IL-15 promptly activated a
Jak3-Jak1-PI3K-Akt pathway that led to the upregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. This 
pathway also induced a delayed but sustained ERK1/2 activation, which not only
was necessary for the maintenance of Bcl-2 but also resulted in the
phosphorylation of extra-long Bim at Ser(65) . The latter event facilitated the
dissociation of Bim from Bcl-2 without affecting Bim abundance in IL-15-treated
CD8αα(+) iIELs. Using an adoptive cell transfer approach, we found that either
overexpression of Bcl-2 or removal of Bim from CD8αα(+) iIELs promoted their
survival in Il15ra(-/-) mice. Taken together, IL-15 promotes CD8αα(+) iIEL
survival by both increasing Bcl-2 levels and dissociating Bim from Bcl-2 through 
activation of a Jak3-Jak1-PI3K-Akt-ERK1/2 pathway, which differs from a
previously reported IL-15-induced survival signal.

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), remains the
leading cause of mortality from a single infectious agent. Each year around 9
million individuals newly develop active TB disease, and over 2 billion
individuals are latently infected with M.tb worldwide, thus being at risk of
developing TB reactivation disease later in life. The underlying mechanisms and
pathways of protection against TB in humans, as well as the dynamics of the host 
response to M.tb infection, are incompletely understood. We carried out
whole-genome expression profiling on a cohort of TB patients longitudinally
sampled along 3 time-points: during active infection, during treatment, and after
completion of curative treatment. We identified molecular signatures involving
the upregulation of type-1 interferon (α/β) mediated signaling and chronic
inflammation during active TB disease in an Indonesian population, in line with
results from two recent studies in ethnically and epidemiologically different
populations in Europe and South Africa. Expression profiles were captured in
neutrophil-depleted blood samples, indicating a major contribution of lymphocytes
and myeloid cells. Expression of type-1 interferon (α/β) genes mediated was also 
upregulated in the lungs of M.tb infected mice and in infected human macrophages.
In patients, the regulated gene expression-signature normalized during treatment,
including the type-1 interferon mediated signaling and a concurrent opposite
regulation of interferon-gamma. Further analysis revealed IL15RA, UBE2L6 and GBP4
as molecules involved in the type-I interferon response in all three experimental
models. Our data is highly suggestive that the innate immune type-I interferon
signaling cascade could be used as a quantitative tool for monitoring active TB
disease, and provide evidence that components of the patient's blood gene
expression signature bear similarities to the pulmonary and macrophage response
to mycobacterial infection.

Kong, China.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation of tumor-related genes has been reported in
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric cancers. This study sought to profile
EBV-driven hypermethylation in EBV-infected cells.
METHODS: The EBV-positive AGS gastric cancer cell line (AGS-EBV) and EBV-negative
AGS cells were used in this study. DNA methyltransferase-3b (DNMT3b) activity was
assessed by EpiQuick activity assay, and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles
were assessed by methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation microarray assay.
RESULTS: EBV infection was confirmed in AGS-EBV cells by EBV-encoded RNA in situ 
hybridization. Expression and activity of DNA methyltransferase-3b (DNMT3b) was
significantly increased in AGS-EBV compared to AGS. Ectopic expression of LMP2A
(latent membrane protein 2A) in AGS increased activity of DNMT3b. A total of 1065
genes were differentially methylated by EBV infection (fold-changes ≥ 2, P < .05)
in AGS-EBV compared to AGS cells. The majority of the differentially methylated
genes (83.2%, 886 of 1065 genes) had cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG)
hypermethylation in AGS-EBV (fold-changes 2.43∼65.2) versus that found in AGS
cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed that hypermethylated genes were enriched
in the important cancer pathways (≥ 10 genes each, P ≤ .05) including
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, cell adhesion molecules, wnt
signaling pathway, and so forth. Six novel hypermethylated candidates (IL15RA,
REC8, SSTR1, EPHB6, MDGA2, and SCARF2) were further validated. Higher levels of
DNA methylation were confirmed for all these genes in AGS-EBV cells by bisulfite 
genomic sequencing. Furthermore, these candidates were silenced or down-regulated
in AGS-EBV cells, but can be restored by demethylation treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: EBV infection in AGS cells induced aberrant CpG hypermethylation of 
886 genes involving in important cancer-related pathways. Induction of promoter
methylation by EBV is regulated by up-regulation of DNMT3b through LMP2A.

We conducted a population-based case-control study in Connecticut women to test
the hypothesis that genetic variations in Th1 and Th2 cytokine genes modify the
relationship between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and risk of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL). Compared to women without a history of HRT use, women with a
history of HRT use had a significantly decreased risk of NHL if they carried
IFNGR2 (rs1059293) CT/TT genotypes (OR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3-0.9), IL13 (rs20541) GG 
genotype (OR = 0.6, 95%CI: 0.4-0.9), and IL13 (rs1295686) CC genotype (OR = 0.6, 
95%CI: 0.4-0.8), but not among women who carried IFNGR2 CC, IL13 AG/AA, and
IL13CT/TT genotypes. A similar pattern was also observed for B-cell lymphoma but 
not for T-cell lymphoma. A statistically significant interaction was observed for
IFNGR2 (rs1059293 P(for interaction) = 0.024), IL13(rs20541 P(for interaction) = 
0.005), IL13 (rs1295686 P(for interaction) = 0.008), and IL15RA (rs2296135 P(for 
interaction) = 0.049) for NHL overall; IL13 (rs20541 P(for interaction) =
0.0009), IL13(rs1295686 P(for interaction) = 0.0002), and IL15RA (rs2296135 P(for
interaction) = 0.041) for B-cell lymphoma. The results suggest that common
genetic variation in Th1/Th2 pathway genes may modify the association between HRT
and NHL risk.

Several cases of T-cell leukemia caused by gammaretroviral insertional
mutagenesis in children treated for x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) by transplantation of autologous gene-modified stem cells were reported.
In a comparative analysis, we recently showed that mature T cells, on the
contrary, are highly resistant to transformation by gammaretroviral gene
transfer. In the present study, we observed immortalization of a single T-cell
clone in vitro after gammaretroviral transduction of the T-cell protooncogene
LMO2. This clone was CD4/CD8 double-negative, but expressed a single rearranged
T-cell receptor. The clone was able to overgrow nonmanipulated competitor T-cell 
populations in vitro, but no tumor formation was observed after transplantation
into Rag-1 deficient recipients. The retroviral integration site (RIS) was found 
to be near the IL2RA and IL15RA genes. As a consequence, both receptors were
constitutively upregulated on the RNA and protein level and the immortalized cell
clone was highly IL-2 dependent. Ectopic expression of both, the IL2RA chain and 
LMO2, induced long-term growth in cultured primary T cells. This study
demonstrates that insertional mutagenesis can contribute to immortalization of
mature T cells, although this is a rare event. Furthermore, the results show that
signaling of the IL-2 receptor and the protooncogene LMO2 can act synergistically
in maligniant transformation of mature T lymphocytes.

characteristics of mouse fast skeletal muscles.

IL-15 receptor α (IL-15Rα) is a component of the heterotrimeric plasma membrane
receptor for the pleiotropic cytokine IL-15. However, IL-15Rα is not merely an
IL-15 receptor subunit, as mice lacking either IL-15 or IL-15Rα have unique
phenotypes. IL-15 and IL-15Rα have been implicated in muscle phenotypes, but a
role in muscle physiology has not been defined. Here, we have shown that loss of 
IL-15Rα induces a functional oxidative shift in fast muscles, substantially
increasing fatigue resistance and exercise capacity. IL-15Rα-knockout
(IL-15Rα-KO) mice ran greater distances and had greater ambulatory activity than 
controls. Fast muscles displayed fatigue resistance and a slower contractile
phenotype. The molecular signature of these muscles included altered markers of
mitochondrial biogenesis and calcium homeostasis. Morphologically, fast muscles
had a greater number of muscle fibers, smaller fiber areas, and a greater ratio
of nuclei to fiber area. The alterations of physiological properties and
increased resistance to fatigue in fast muscles are consistent with a shift
toward a slower, more oxidative phenotype. Consistent with a conserved functional
role in humans, a genetic association was found between a SNP in the IL15RA gene 
and endurance in athletes stratified by sport. Therefore, we propose that IL-15Rα
has a role in defining the phenotype of fast skeletal muscles in vivo.

IL-15Rα of radiation-resistant cells is necessary and sufficient for thymic
invariant NKT cell survival and functional maturation.

The development of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells depends on the thymus. After
positive selection by CD4(+)CD8(+)CD1d(+) cortical thymocytes, iNKT cells proceed
from CD44(low)NK1.1(-) (stage 1) to CD44(high)NK1.1(-) (stage 2), and then to
CD44(high)NK1.1(+) (stage 3) cells. The programming of cytokine production occurs
along the three differentiation stages, whereas the acquisition of NK receptors
occurs at stage 3. Stage 3 thymic iNKT cells are specifically reduced in
Il15ra(-/-) mice. The mechanism underlying this homeostatic deficiency and
whether the IL-15 system affects other thymic iNKT cell developmental events
remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that increased cell death
contributed to the reduction of stage 3 cells in Il15ra(-/-) mice, as knockout of
Bim restored this population. IL-15-dependent upregulation of Bcl-2 in stage 3
cells affected cell survival, as overexpression of hBcl-2 partially restored
stage 3 cells in Il15ra(-/-) mice. Moreover, thymic iNKT cells in Il15ra(-/-)
mice were impaired in functional maturation, including the acquisition of Ly49
and NKG2 receptors and the programming of cytokine production. Finally, IL-15Rα
expressed by radiation-resistant cells is necessary and sufficient to support the
survival as well as the examined maturation events of thymic iNKT cells.

Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Recently, a number of evidences have been reported concerning the
genetic factor involved in the development of ossification of the posterior
longitudinal ligament (OPLL). The purpose of this study was to investigate single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the interleukin 15 receptor, alpha (IL15RA)
gene as a risk factor in Korean patients with OPLL.
DESIGN: To investigate the genetic association, two coding SNPs (rs2296139,
Thr73Thr; rs2228059, Asn182Thr) in IL15RA were genotyped in 166 OPLL patients and
230 control subjects. SNPStats, SNPAnalyzer, and Helixtree programs were used for
association analysis.
RESULTS: In the present study, we found the association between a missense SNP
(rs2228059) and the risk of OPLL in codominant (p = 0.0028, OR = 1.58, 95% CI =
1.17-2.14), dominant (p = 0.0071, OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.17-2.82), and recessive
models (p = 0.036, OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.04-3.09). The frequency of rs2228059
allele was significantly associated with the susceptibility of OPLL (p = 0.0043, 
OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.14-2.02). After Bonferroni correction, the missense SNP
(rs2228059, Asn182Thr) still had significant correlations (p = 0.0056 in
codominant model; p = 0.0142 in dominant model; p = 0.0086 in allele analysis).
Haplotype variation in IL15RA was associated with OPLL (global haplotype test, p 
= 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IL15RA polymorphism may be associated
with the susceptibility of OPLL in Korean population.

Interleukin-15, IL-15 Receptor-Alpha, and Obesity: Concordance of Laboratory
Animal and Human Genetic Studies.

Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a cytokine which inhibits lipid deposition in cultured 
adipocytes and decreases adipose tissue deposition in laboratory rodents. In
human subjects, negative correlations between circulating IL-15 levels and both
total and abdominal fat have been demonstrated. Deletions of IL15 in humans and
mice are associated with obesity, while gain-of-function IL-15 overexpressing
mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity. IL-15 is highly (but not exclusively)
expressed at the mRNA level in skeletal muscle tissue, and the regulation of
IL-15 translation and secretion is complex. Conflicting evidence exists
concerning whether circulating IL-15 is released from skeletal muscle tissue in
response to exercise or other physiological stimuli. The IL-15 receptor-alpha
(IL-15Rα) subunit has a complex biochemistry, encoding both membrane-bound and
soluble forms which can modulate IL-15 secretion and bioactivity. The gene
encoding this receptor, IL15RA, resides on human chromosome 10p, a location
linked to obesity and type-2 diabetes. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in human IL15RA and IL15 correlate with adiposity and markers of the
metabolic syndrome. Genetic variation in IL15RA may modulate IL-15
bioavailability, which in turn regulates adiposity. Thus, IL-15 and the IL-15Rα
may be novel targets for pharmacologic control of obesity in the human
population.

B cells not only play a pivotal role in humoral immunity, but also are involved
in a broad spectrum of immune responses, including antigen presentation and
T-cell function regulation. The identification of cell-surface CD molecules
derived from a series of Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens (HLDA)
Workshops has been instrumental to the discovery and functional characterization 
of human B-cell populations. Moreover, many events regulating B-cell development,
activation, and effector functions are orchestrated by these cell-surface
molecules. During the Ninth HLDA Workshop (HLDA9) eighteen new CDs were allocated
to cell-surface molecules expressed on B cells: CD210a (IL10RA), CD215 (IL15RA), 
CD270 (TNFRSF14), CD307a (FCRL1), CD307b (FCRL2), CD307c (FCRL3), CD307d (FCRL4),
CD351 (FCAMR), CD352 (SLAMF6), CD353 (SLAMF8), CD354 (TREM1), CD355 (CRTAM),
CD357 (TNFRSF18), CD358 (TNFRSF21), CD360 (IL21RA), CD361 (EVI2B), CD362 (SDC2), 
and CD363 (S1PR1). Here we present their expression patterns on leukocytes,
including T lymphocytes, NK cells, granulocytes, monocytes, plasmacytoid and
monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and several B-cell subsets. These new CD
molecules are expressed on B cells at various stages of differentiation; from
bone marrow precursor pro-B cells to plasma cells. Three of them, CD307a, CD307b 
and CD307d, exhibit a B-cell restricted expression pattern, whereas the rest are 
also present on other leukocytes. In this paper we also review the structural
characteristics, expression, and function of these new CD molecules. The
availability of monoclonal antibodies directed against novel B cell-surface
molecules will have broad implications not only for B-cell biology, but also for 
the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells capable of
initiating primary immune responses. They have been intensively studied and are
used in both basic immunology research and clinical immunotherapy. However, the
genetic pathways leading to DC differentiation and maturation remain poorly
understood. Using focused microarrays with oligonucletotide probes for 120 genes 
encoding co-stimulatory molecules, chemokines, chemokine receptors, cytokines,
cytokine receptors, TLRs, and several other related molecules, we analyzed the
kinetics of gene expression for the overall differentiation process of monocytes 
into mature DC. In parallel, we compared the transcriptional profiles in DC
maturation in the presence of LPS, TNF-alpha or trimeric CD40L. We found similar 
transcriptional profiles for early immature DC and immature DC, respectively
generated by culturing monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4 for three or six days. We
identified sets of common and stimuli-specific genes, the expression of which
changed following stimulation with LPS, TNF-alpha or CD40L. A dynamic analysis of
the entire DC differentiation and maturation process showed that some important
inflammatory and constitutive chemokines are transcribed in both immature and
mature DC. The correlative expression kinetics of the gene pairs IL1R1/IL1R2,
IL15/IL15RA, DC-SIGN/ICAM-2 and DC-SIGN/ICAM-3 imply that they all play crucial
roles in mediating DC functions. Thus, our analysis with focused microarrays shed
light on the transcriptional kinetics of DC differentiation and maturation, and
this method may also prove useful for identifying novel marker genes involved in 
DC functions.

BACKGROUND: White adipose tissue (WAT) from visceral adiposity plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Development of 
NASH and its progression to fibrosis is partially due to cytokines and adipokines
produced by WAT. The aim of this study was to assess the association of hepatic
fibrosis and NASH by evaluating the intrinsic differences in the inflammatory
cytokine signaling in the visceral adipose tissue obtained from morbidly obese
patients.
METHODS: We used targeted microarrays representing human genes involved in the
inflammatory and fibrogenic reactions to profile visceral adipose samples of 15
well-matched NASH patients with and without fibrosis. Additionally, visceral
adipose samples were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction profiling
of 84 inflammations related genes.
RESULTS: Eight genes (CCL2, CCL4, CCL18, CCR1, IL10RB, IL15RA, and LTB) were
differentially expressed in NASH with fibrosis. Additionally, an overlapping but 
distinct list of the differentially expressed genes were found in NASH with type 
II diabetes (DM; IL8, BLR1, IL2RA, CD40LG, IL1RN, IL15RA, and CCL4) as compared
to NASH without DM.
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory cytokines are differentially expressed in the adipose
tissue of NASH with fibrosis, as well in NASH with DM. These findings point at
the interaction of adipose inflammatory cytokines, DM, hepatic fibrosis in NASH, 
and its progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.

Interferon (IFN)-gamma plays a critical role in murine uterine spiral artery
remodeling for successful pregnancy. The effect of IFN-gamma on human uterine
microvasculature, however, remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was
to identify the genes regulated by IFN-gamma in human uterine microvascular
endothelial cells. The effect of IFN-gamma on the gene expression profile in
human uterine microvascular endothelial cells was evaluated by cDNA microarray
analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction for the selected genes of interest. In vivo expression of the protein
encoded by some of these genes in human uterine microvascular endothelial cells
was evaluated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Treatment with 10
ng/ml IFN-gamma for 4 h induced a significant > or =2-fold change in 29 genes in 
pooled human uterine microvascular endothelial cells; a total of 20 genes were
up-regulated, whereas nine genes were down-regulated. The genes significantly
up-regulated included chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL8, IL15RA, and CCL5), enzymes
(GBP5, TAP1, CYP27B1, SOD2, MX1, CASP1, and PTGES), and transcription factors
(TFAP2C, IRF1, NFE2L3). The genes significantly down-regulated following
IFN-gamma treatment included cytokines/cytokine receptors (CSF2, IL1R2, and
SPP1), and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (WISP2 and IGFBP3). The
results of the cDNA microarray analysis were confirmed by quantitative real-time 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the selected 17 genes of
interest. The immunoreactivity for the proteins encoded by IL15RA, IFI30, and MX1
was detected in human uterine microvascular endothelial cells in vivo, whereas
the immunoreactivity for CCNA1 and NQO1 was not detectable. These results suggest
that IFN-gamma regulates the gene expression involved in natural killer cell
recruitment, embryo and trophoblast migration, endometrial decidualization,
angiogenesis, angiostasis, and anti-viral infection in human uterine
microvascular endothelial cells.

This study focused on the cell activating capacity of extremely low frequency
magnetic fields (ELF-MF) on human umbilical cord blood-derived monocytes. Our
results confirm the previous findings of cell activating capacity of ELF-MF (1.0 
mT) in human monocytes, which was detected as an increased ROS release.
Furthermore, gene expression profiling (whole-genome cDNA array Human Unigene
RZPD-2) was performed to achieve a comprehensive view of involved genes during
the cell activation process after 45 min ELF-MF exposure. Our results indicate
the alteration of 986 genes involved in metabolism, cellular physiological
processes, signal transduction and immune response. Significant regulations could
be analyzed for 5 genes (expression >2- or <0.5-fold): IL15RA (Interleukin 15
receptor, alpha chain), EPS15R (Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway
substrate 15 - like 1), DNMT3A (Hypothetical protein MGC16121), DNMT3A (DNA
(cytosine-5) methyltransferase 3 alpha), and one gene with no match to known
genes, DKFZP586J1624. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of the kinetic of the expression 
of IL15RA, and IL10RA during 45 min ELF-MF exposure indicates the regulation of
cell activation via the alternative pathway, whereas the delayed gene expression 
of FOS, IL2RA and the melatonin synthesizing enzyme HIOMT suggests the
suppression of inflammatory processes. Accordingly, we suggest that ELF-MF
activates human monocytes via the alternative pathway.

Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is an anabolic cytokine that is produced in skeletal
muscle and directly affects muscle anabolism in animal and in vitro models. The
contribution of IL-15 variability in muscle responses to 10 wk of resistance
exercise training in young men and women was examined by measuring acute and
chronic changes in IL-15 protein in plasma and characterizing genetic variation
in the IL-15 receptor-alpha gene (IL15RA). Participants trained 3 days a week at 
75% of one repetition maximum, performing three sets (6-10 repetitions) of 13
resistance exercises. Plasma IL-15 protein was significantly increased (P < 0.05)
immediately after acute resistance exercise but did not change with training and 
was not associated with variability in muscle responses with training. A single
nucleotide polymorphism in exon 7 of IL15RA was strongly associated with muscle
hypertrophy and accounted for 7.1% of the variation in regression modeling. A
polymorphism in exon 4 was also independently associated with muscle hypertrophy 
and accounted for an additional 3.5% of the variation in hypertrophy. These
results suggest that IL-15 is an important mediator of muscle mass response to
resistance exercise training in humans and that genetic variation in IL15RA
accounts for a significant proportion of the variability in this response.

One of the major causes of blindness is primary open-angle glaucoma, which
affects millions of elderly people worldwide. Genetic studies have so far mapped 
three loci for the adult-onset form of this condition to the 2cen-q13, 3q21-q24, 
and 8q23 regions. Herein, we report the localization of a fourth locus, to the
10p15-p14 region, in one large British family with a classical form of
normal-tension open-angle glaucoma. Of the 42 meioses genotyped in this pedigree,
39 subjects (16 affected) inherited a haplotype compatible with their prior
clinical designation, whereas the remaining 3 were classified as unknown.
Although a maximum LOD score of 10.00 at a recombination fraction of straight
theta=.00 was obtained with D10S1216, 21 other markers provided significant
values, varying between 3.77 and 9.70. When only the affected meioses of this
kindred were analyzed, LOD scores remained statistically significant, ranging
from 3.16 (D10S527) to 3.57 (D10S506). Two critical recombinational events in the
affected subjects positioned this new locus to a region of approximately 21 cM,
flanked by D10S1729 and D10S1664. However, an additional recombination in a
59-year-old unaffected female suggests that this locus resides between D10S585
(or D10S1172) and D10S1664, within a genetic distance of 5-11 cM. However, the
latter minimum region must be taken cautiously, because the incomplete penetrance
has previously been documented for this group of eye conditions. A partial list
of genes that positionally are considered as candidates includes NET1, PRKCT,
ITIH2, IL2RA, IL15RA, IT1H2, hGATA3, the mRNA for open reading frame KIAA0019,
and the gene for D123 protein.

Interleukins-2 and -15 (IL-2 and IL-15) are cytokines with overlapping but
distinct biological effects. Their receptors share two subunits (the IL-2R beta
and -gamma chains) that are essential for signal transduction. The IL-2 receptor 
requires an additional IL-2-specific alpha subunit for high affinity IL-2
binding. Recently, a murine IL-15-specific alpha subunit was identified, cloned, 
and shown to be structurally related to IL-2R alpha. However, the murine IL-15R
alpha alone bound IL-15 with a 1000-fold higher affinity than that seen with
IL-2R alpha and IL-2. We now extend these studies into the human system with the 
isolation of three differentially spliced human IL-15R alpha variants that are
all capable of high affinity binding of IL-15. The cytoplasmic domain of IL-15R
alpha, like that of IL-2R alpha, is dispensable for mitogenic signaling,
suggesting that the primary role of the alpha chains is to confer high affinity
binding. At high concentrations, IL-15, like IL-2, is able to signal through a
complex of IL-2R beta and -gamma in the absence of the alpha subunit.
Furthermore, the IL15RA and IL2RA genes have a similar intron-exon organization
and are closely linked in both human and murine genomes. However, the
distribution of expression of the IL-15R alpha is much wider than that of the
IL-2R alpha, suggesting a broader range of cellular targets for IL-15.
